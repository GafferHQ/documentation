CameraTweaks
============

Applies modifications, also known as "tweaks," to camera
parameters or render options in the scene. Supports any number
of tweaks, and custom camera parameters. Tweaks to camera
parameters apply to every camera specified by the filter.

Tweaks apply to every camera specified by the filter.

Can add new camera parameters or render options.

Any existing parameters/options can be replaced or removed.
Numeric parameters/options can also be added to, subtracted
from, or multiplied.

Tweaks are applied in order, so if there is more than one tweak
to the same parameter/option, the first tweak will be applied
first, then the second, etc.
