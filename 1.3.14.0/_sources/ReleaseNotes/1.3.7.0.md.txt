1.3.7.0
=======

Improvements
------------

- ArnoldShader : Improved support for camera projections by exposing the `camera` plug on the `camera_projection` shader.
- Instancer :
  - Improved scene generation for encapsulated instancers significantly, with some production scenes now generating 5-7x faster.
  - Added `omitDuplicateIds` plug, to determine whether points with duplicate IDs are ignored or should trigger an error.
- ScenePathPlugValueWidget : Added fallback to browsing the focussed scene when no other scene can be found. This makes the widget suitable for use on ShaderNodes.
- Windows : Disabled Arnold's ADP usage and crash reporting module by default. Users can enable it by setting `ARNOLD_ADP_DISABLE=0` for Arnold versions after 7.1.4.0 or `ARNOLD_ADP_OPTIN=1` for earlier versions.

Fixes
-----

- Catalogue : Fixed performance regressive when saving interactive renders with multiple AOVs (introduced in 1.3.6.1).

API
---

- Capsule : Added protected `renderOptions()` and `throwIfNoScene()` methods.
- ScenePath : Added support for passing `nullptr` for the scene.
- ArnoldShaderUI : Added support for `camera` widget type metadata, to add a camera browser to a string parameter.
