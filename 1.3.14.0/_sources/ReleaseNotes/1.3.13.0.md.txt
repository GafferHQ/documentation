1.3.13.0
========

Improvements
------------

- Viewer : Added <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>PgUp</kbd> shortcut for displaying the RGBA image layer (or the first available layer if RGBA doesn't exist).
- RenderPassEditor :
  - Added "Inclusions", "Exclusions" and "Additional Lights" columns, to provide control over the locations included in the render for each render pass.
  - Added the ability to display render passes grouped in a hierarchy generated from the render pass name. The default grouping uses the first token delimited by "_" from the render pass name, such that render passes named "char_gafferBot" and "char_cow" would be displayed under a "/char" group, while "prop_ball" and "prop_box" would be displayed under a "/prop" group.
  - Render pass grouping can be configured in a startup file by using `GafferSceneUI.RenderPassEditor.registerPathGroupingFunction( f )`, where `f` is a function that receives a render pass name and returns the path that the render pass should be grouped under.
  - Grouped display can be enabled by default in a startup file by using `Gaffer.Metadata.registerValue( GafferSceneUI.RenderPassEditor.Settings, "displayGrouped", "userDefault", IECore.BoolData( True ) )`.
  - Dragging cells selected from the "Name" column now provides a list of the selected render pass names, rather than their paths.
  - Disabled render pass names are now dimmed to more clearly indicate their state.
- RenderPassEditor, LightEditor, PathListingWidget : Boolean values are now displayed as checkboxes rather than `0` or `1`.
- StandardOptions : Added `inclusions`, `exclusions` and `additionalLights` plugs, to control which locations are included in a render based on set expressions entered on these plugs. These, plus the existing `includedPurposes` plug are now grouped under the "Render Set" section of the UI.
- GafferScene : Registered the "RenderSetAdaptor" adapting the `render:inclusions`, `render:exclusions` and `render:additionalLights` options to prune scene locations before rendering.

API
---

- ScenePath : Added automatic conversion of a list of Python strings to a ScenePath.
