Resize
======

Resizes the image to a new resolution, scaling the
contents to fit the new size.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image

format
------

The new format (resolution and pixel aspect ratio)
of the output image.

fitMode
-------

Determines how the image is scaled to fit the new
resolution. If the aspect ratios of the input and
the output images are the same, then this has no
effect, otherwise it dictates what method is used
to preserve the aspect ratio of the data.

Horizontal
:       The image is scaled so that it fills the full
        width of the output resolution and aspect ratio
        is preserved.

Vertical
:       The image is scaled so that it fills the full
        height of the output resolution and aspect ratio
        is preserved.

Fit
:       Automatically picks Horizontal or Vertical such
        that all of the input image is contained within
        the output image. Padding is applied top and
        bottom or left and right as necessary.

Fill
:       Automatically picks Horizontal or Vertical such
        that the full output resolution is covered. The
        image contents will extend outside the top and
        bottom or left and right of the display window
        as necessary.

Distort
:       Distorts the image so that the input display
        window is fitted exactly to the output display
        window.

filter
------

The pixel used when transforming the image. Each
filter provides different tradeoffs between sharpness and
the danger of aliasing or ringing.
