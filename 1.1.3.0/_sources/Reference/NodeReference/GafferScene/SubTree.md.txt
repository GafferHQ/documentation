SubTree
=======

A node for extracting a specific branch from a scene.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

root
----

The location to become the new root for the output scene.
All locations below this will be kept, and all others will
be discarded.

includeRoot
-----------

Causes the root location to also be kept in the output scene, in
addition to its children. For instance, if the scene contains only
`/city/street/house` and the root is set to `/city/street`, then the
new scene will by default contain only `/house` - but the
`includeRoot` setting will cause it to contain `/street/house`
instead.

inheritTransform
----------------

Maintains the subtree's world-space position by applying the `root`
location's full transform to the subtree's children.

inheritAttributes
-----------------

Maintains the subtree's attributes (including shader assignments) by
applying the `root` location's full attributes to the subtree's
children.

inheritSetMembership
--------------------

Maintains the subtree's membership in sets by transferring the
`root` location's memberships to the subtree's children.
