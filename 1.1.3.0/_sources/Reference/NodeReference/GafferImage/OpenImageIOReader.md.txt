OpenImageIOReader
=================

Utility node which reads image files from disk using OpenImageIO.
All file types supported by OpenImageIO are supported by the
OpenImageIOReader.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

fileName
--------

The name of the file to be read. File sequences with
arbitrary padding may be specified using the '#' character
as a placeholder for the frame numbers. If this file sequence
format is used, then missingFrameMode will be activated.

**Supported file extensions** : bmp, dib, cin, dds, dpx, fits, hdr, rgbe, ico, iff, z, jpg, jpe, jpeg, jif, jfif, jfi, jp2, j2k, j2c, null, nul, exr, sxr, mxr, png, ppm, pgm, pbm, pnm, pfm, psd, pdd, psb, bay, bmq, cr2, crw, cs1, dc2, dcr, dng, erf, fff, k25, kdc, mdc, mos, mrw, nef, orf, pef, pxn, raf, raw, rdc, sr2, srf, x3f, arw, 3fr, cine, ia, kc2, mef, nrw, qtk, rw2, sti, rwl, srw, drf, dsc, ptx, cap, iiq, rwz, cr3, rla, sgi, rgb, rgba, bw, int, inta, socket, pic, tif, tiff, tx, env, sm, vsm, tga, tpic, term, zfile, osl, oso, oslgroup, oslbody

refreshCount
------------

May be incremented to force a reload if the file has
changed on disk - otherwise old contents may still
be loaded via Gaffer's cache.

missingFrameMode
----------------

Determines how missing frames are handled when the input
fileName is a file sequence (uses the '#' character).
The default behaviour is to throw an exception, but it
can also hold the last valid frame in the sequence, or
return a black image which matches the data window and
display window of the previous valid frame in the sequence.

availableFrames
---------------

An output of the available frames for the given file sequence.
Returns an empty vector when the input fileName is not a file
sequence, even if it has a file-sequence-like structure.

channelInterpretation
---------------------

Documented in ImageReader, where it is exposed to users.
