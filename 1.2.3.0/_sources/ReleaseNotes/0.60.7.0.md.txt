0.60.7.0
========

Improvements
------------

- Spreadsheet : The popup editor for lists of items (e.g. scene paths) is now at least as wide as the spreadsheet column itself.
- VectorDataWidget : Added <kbd>Backspace</kbd> shortcut for deleting the selected rows.
- GraphEditor : Simplified logic for drawing strike-throughs on disabled nodes. The strike-through is now only drawn for nodes which have a constant value for their `enabled` plug. This avoids blocking the UI waiting for computes that drive the `enabled` plug, and avoids erroneously drawing the strike-through when the appropriate context to evaluate the plug in is not known.
- Animation : Added compatibility for loading animation from Gaffer 0.61.

Fixes
-----

- Viewer : Fixed drawing of CoordinateSystems (bug introduced in 0.60.0.0).
- ErrorDialogue : Fixed Python 3 incompatibility in `displayException()`.
