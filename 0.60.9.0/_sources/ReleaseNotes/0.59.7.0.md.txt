0.59.7.0
========

Improvements
------------

- Parent :
  - Added `parentVariable` plug, to create a context variable that passes the
    parent location to nodes upstream of the `children` plug. This allows the children
    to be varied procedurally according to what they are parented to.
  - Added `destination` plug, to allow children to be placed elsewhere in the scene
    while still inheriting the transform of the "parent". This is particularly useful
    when parenting lights to geometry.
- Seeds : Added `destination` plug, to control where the points are placed in the scene
  relative to the meshes they are generated from.
- Duplicate :
  - Added `filter` input, allowing multiple objects to be duplicated at once.
  - Added `destination` plug, to control where the copies are placed relative to the
    original.
  - Improved performance for large numbers of copies.
  - Deprecated the `target` plug. Please use filters instead.
- Outputs : Reduced the time taken to show the NodeEditor by around 90%.
- NodeEditor : The "Node Name" label is now draggable. For instance, it can be dragged to the PythonEditor to get a reference to the node or to the GraphEditor to find the node in the graph.
- GraphEditor : Improved framing of nodes dragged and dropped onto the GraphEditor :
  - Changed pointer to indicate that framing will take place.
  - Nodes are framed directly under the pointer instead of at the centre of the widget.
  - Fixed framing of nodes not currently in the GraphEditor.
  - Removed framing of _plugs_ dragged to the GraphEditor. This was unintuitive and interacted poorly with the dragging of plugs to make
    connections. The NodeEditor's "Node Name" label can be dragged instead to locate a node from the NodeEditor.
- SceneInspector : Improved history view :
  - Added the full path to nodes so that nodes nested in Boxes can be identified.
  - Added edit button to open a NodeEditor for nodes in the history.
  - Fixed gap in between sections.
- FilterResults : Added `root` plug. This can be used to limit the results to `root` and its descendants.
- CollectScenes : Added tab completion and a scene browser to the UI for the `sourceRoot` plug.
- BackgroundTaskDialogue :
  - Removed focus from "Cancel" button to make it harder to cancel accidentally.
  - Added <kbd>Esc</kbd> cancellation shortcut.

Fixes
-----

- Widget : Fixed drag handling bug that could cause `dragEnterSignal()` to be emitted again on a widget that had already accepted the drag.
- FilterResults : Fixed bug handling matches at the root location.
- NodeEditor : Fixed activator and summary updates which were skipped if the layout was not visible when the node was edited.
- Dispatcher : Fixed dispatching when `dispatcher.batchSize` or `dispatcher.immediate` are driven by context variables.
- SceneNode : Fixed bug hashing the transform for the root location.

API
---

- SceneAlgo :
  - Added overloads with `root` argument for `parallelTraverse()`, `filteredParallelTraverse()`, `matchingPaths()` and `matchingPathsHash()`.
  - Deprecated `matchingPaths()` overloads taking `Filter *`. Pass a `Filter.out` plug instead.
  - Added Python bindings for `matchingPathsHash()`.
- ScenePlug :
  - Added support for `..` in `stringToPath()`.
  - Added `stringToPath()` and `pathToString()` overloads that return a result rather than passing it by reference.
- GafferUI.FileMenu : Added `dialogueParentWindow` argument to `addScript()`.
- Spreadsheet : Added support for per-plug `ui:spreadsheet:selectorValue` metadata. This defines the initial value for `selector` when the UI is used to create a spreadsheet for the plug.
