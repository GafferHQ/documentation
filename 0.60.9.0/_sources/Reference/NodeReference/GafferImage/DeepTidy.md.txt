DeepTidy
========

Ensures deep samples are sorted and non-overlapping, and optionally
discards samples that are completely transparent, or covered by other
samples.

pruneTransparent
----------------

When tidying, omits fully transparent samples.  This is usually just an optimization,
but it could affect the composited result if you start with purely additive samples that have
zero alpha, but still add to the color.

pruneOccluded
-------------

When tidying, omits samples which are blocked by samples in front of them ( occluded samples
have no effect on the composited result.

occludedThreshold
-----------------

How blocked does a sample have to be before it is omitted.  By default, only 100% occluded samples
are omitted, but if you select 0.99, then samples with only 1% visibility would also be omitted.
The composited result is preserved by combining the values of any omitted samples with the last
sample generated.  Using a threshold lower than 0.99 before doing a DeepMerge or DeepHoldout
could introduce large errors, however.
