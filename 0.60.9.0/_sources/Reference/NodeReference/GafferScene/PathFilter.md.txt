PathFilter
==========

Chooses locations by matching them against a list of
paths.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the filter. When it is off, the
filter does not match any locations.

out
---

The result of the filter. This should be connected into
the "filter" plug of a FilteredSceneProcessor.

paths
-----

The list of paths to the locations to be matched by the filter.
A path is formed by a sequence of names separated by '/', and
specifies the hierarchical position of a location within the scene.
Paths may use Gaffer's standard wildcard characters to match
multiple locations.

The '*' wildcard matches any sequence of characters within
an individual name, but never matches across names separated
by a '/'.

 - /robot/*Arm matches /robot/leftArm, /robot/rightArm and
   /robot/Arm. But does not match /robot/limbs/leftArm or
   /robot/arm.

The "..." wildcard matches any sequence of names, and can be
used to match locations no matter where they are parented in
the hierarchy.

 - /.../house matches /house, /street/house and /city/street/house.

roots
-----

An optional filter input used to provide multiple root locations
which the `paths` are relative to. This can be useful when working
on a single asset in isolation, and then placing it into multiple
locations within a layout. When no filter is connected, all `paths`
are treated as being relative to `/`, the true scene root.
