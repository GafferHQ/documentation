0.61.13.0
=========

Features
--------

- USDLayerWriter : Added a new node for baking the difference between two Gaffer scenes into a minimal USD layer on disk.
- USDAttributes : Added a new node for setting USD's `kind` and `purpose`.

Improvements
------------

- Light Editor : Added support for editing visualisation attributes of lights.
- CameraTweaks : Added `Create` mode. This should be used in preference to `Replace` mode when the parameter may not exist.
- PathFilter : Added the ability to select scene locations from currently selected filter entries.

Fixes
-----

- SceneWriter : Fixed bug which caused sibling locations to be reordered.
- ShaderQuery :
  - Fixed error `ShaderQuery : "outPlug" is missing` when promoting a child plug of a query to a `Spreadsheet`.
  - Adding a child plug of a query to a `Spreadsheet` now uses the default name for the spreadsheet column.
- Spreadsheet : Fixed missing `Remove` TweakPlug mode presets.
- SceneAlgo : Fixed `attributeHistory()` results involving an `AttributeTweaks` node with `localise` enabled.

API
---

- EditScopeAlgo : Added support for editing attributes.
- TweakPlug : Added `Create` mode.
- VectorDataWidget : Added `dataMenuSignal` for constructing the context menu. Classes can add their own slots to this signal to modify the context menu. Derived classes should use it in favor of `_contextMenuDefinition()`.
