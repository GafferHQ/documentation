Set
===

Creates and edits sets of objects. Each set contains a list of paths
to locations within the scene. After creation, sets can be used
by the SetFilter to limit scene operations to only the members of
a particular set.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

A filter to define additional paths to be added to
or removed from the set.

> Caution : Using a filter can be very expensive.
It is advisable to limit use to filters with a
limited number of matches and/or sets which are
not used heavily downstream. Wherever possible,
prefer to use the `paths` plug directly instead
of using a filter.

mode
----

Create mode creates a new set containing only the
specified paths. If a set with the same name already
exists, it is replaced.

Add mode adds the specified paths to an existing set,
keeping the paths already in the set. If the set does
not exist yet, this is the same as create mode.

Remove mode removes the specified paths from an
existing set. If the set does not exist yet, nothing
is done.

name
----

The name of the set that will be created or edited.
You can create multiple set names at once by separating them with spaces.

paths
-----

The paths to be added to or removed from the set.
