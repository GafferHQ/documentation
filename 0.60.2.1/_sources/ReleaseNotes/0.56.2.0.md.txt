0.56.2.0
========

Features
--------

- ShuffleAttributes : Added node for copying/renaming attributes ([#3611](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3611)).
- ShufflePrimitiveVariables : Added node for copying/renaming primitive variables ([#3611](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3611)).

Improvements
------------

- Viewer : Added visualisation support for Arnold shader networks connected to light gobos ([#3667](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3667)).
- Render nodes : Added context variables to image metadata ([#3646](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3646)). Currently only a subset of variable types is supported, depending on the renderer used.
- Catalogue : Added customisable columns to display image information ([#3646](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3646)).
- Spreadsheet : Added NodeEditor tool menu items to connect relevant nodes to existing spreadsheet `activeRowNames` plugs.

Fixes
-----

- Expression : Fixed retrieval of boolean context variables via the OSL `context()` function.
- Backdrop : Fixed bug that prevented context variables from being used by the `title` and `description` plugs. All variables from the global script context are now available.
- Box : Fixed bug that allowed locked plugs to be promoted.
- NodeEditor : Fixed bug that allowed the node name to be edited on a locked node.
- InteractiveArnoldRender : Fixed problem that could potentially stop the main RGBA AOV from receiving priority for progressive updates.
- TransformTools : Fixed rare crash triggered by selecting multiple objects.
- SceneAlgo : Fixed bug which could cause hangs when retrieving the source scene from an image via Python.
- Floating Editors : Fixed keyboard shortcuts ([#3632](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3632)).
- ArnoldTextureBake :  Fixed imbalanced distribution of work among tasks when some UDIMs contain many more objects than others.
- Viewer : Fixed bug when using the Crop Window Tool with anamorphic images ([#3690](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3690)).
- UI : Fixed bug that could cause header views to show scroll bars unnecessarily.
- Catalogue :
  - Fixed bug that prevented the loading of images with non-alphanumeric filenames.
  - Fixed bug that prevented drag and drop of certain images into the Catalogue.
- StandardOptions : Fixed bug which meant that the camera chooser dialogue started browsing in the user's home directory, not the root of the scene ([#3695](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3695)).
- Spreadsheet :
  - Fixed scrollbar flickering in Spreadsheets with two rows ([#3628](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3628)).
  - Fixed bug which changed the width of the row name column when new rows were added.
- StandardOptions : Fixed bug which meant that the camera chooser dialogue started browsing in the user's home directory, not the root of the scene ([#3695](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3695)).

API
---

- Gaffer : Added ShufflePlug and ShufflesPlug which facilitate renaming key/value pairs ([#3611](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3611)).
- Metadata : Added support for `renameable` metadata in BoxUI, LabelPlugValueWidget and NameWidget.
- NodeEditor : Deprecated `setReadOnly()` and `getReadOnly()` methods.
- NodeUI : Deprecated `setReadOnly()` and `getReadOnly()` methods.
- PlugValueWidget : Deprecated `setReadOnly()` and `getReadOnly()` methods.
- CatalogueUI : Added column configuration API ([#3646](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3646)).
- PathListingWidget :
	- Added `sortable` kwarg to avoid premature sorting of the path passed to the constructor ([#3684](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3684)).
	- Added `horizontalScrollMode` kwarg to control scroll bar behaviour ([#3684](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3684)).
	- Deprecated `setSortable` and `getSortable` in favour of the constructor argument.
