FilterQuery
===========

so users are free to do as they wish.

scene

The scene to query the filter for.

filter
------

The filter to query.

location

The location within the scene to query the filter at.

> Note : If the location does not exist then the query will not be
> performed and all outputs will be set to their default values.

exactMatch
----------

Outputs `True` if the filter matches the location, and `False` otherwise.

descendantMatch

Outputs `True` if the filter matches a descendant of the location,
and `False` otherwise.

ancestorMatch

and `False` otherwise.

Outputs the location of the first ancestor matched by the filter.
In the case of an exact match, this will be the location itself.
