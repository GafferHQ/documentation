0.45.3.0
========

Features
--------

- GafferSceneUI : Added CameraTool to the Viewer ([#2531](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2531)).
  - This enables the movement of the camera in the viewport to be pushed back upstream
    into the node for the camera or light that is currently being looked through. Note
    that once activated, the CameraTool will remain active even after another tool has
    been chosen.

Improvements
------------

- ShaderUI : Added support for userDefault metadata for shader parameters ([#2544](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2544)).

  - Added `deregisterValue()` overload for string targets.
  - Fixed overwriting of values for string targets.
