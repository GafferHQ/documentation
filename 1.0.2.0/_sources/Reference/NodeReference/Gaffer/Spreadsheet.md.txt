Spreadsheet
===========

Provides a spreadsheet designed for easy management of sets of
associated plug values. Each column of the spreadsheet corresponds
to an output value that can be connected to drive a plug on another
node. Each row of the spreadsheet provides candidate values for each
output, along with a row name and enabled status. Row names are matched
against a selector to determine which row is passed through to the output.
Row matching is performed as follows :

- Matching starts with the second row and considers all subsequent
  rows one by one until a match is found. The first matching row
  is the one that is chosen.
- Matching is performed using Gaffer's standard wildcard matching.
  Each "name" may contain several individual patterns each separated
  by spaces.
- The first row is used as a default, and is chosen only if no other
  row matches.

> Note : The matching rules are identical to the ones used by the
> NameSwitch node.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

selector
--------

The value that the row names will be matched against.
Typically this will refer to a Context Variable using
the `${variableName}` syntax.

rows
----

Holds a child RowPlug for each row in the spreadsheet.

out
---

The outputs from the spreadsheet. Contains a child plug for each
column in the spreadsheet.

enabledRowNames
---------------

An output plug containing the names of all currently enabled rows.

resolvedRows
------------

An output plug containing the resolved cell values for all enabled
rows, This can be used to drive expressions in situations where the
standard `out` plug is not useful, or would be awkward to use. The
values are formatted as follows :

```
{
    "row1Name" : { "columnName" : columnValue, ... },
    "row2Name" : { "columnName" : columnValue, ... },
    ...
}
```

> Note : The output is completely independent of the value of
> `selector`.

activeRowIndex
--------------

An output containing the index of the row that matches the selector
in the current context.

> Tip : The default row has index `0`, which converts to `False`
> when used to drive a BoolPlug via a connection (all other values
> convert to `True`). Therefore `Spreadsheet.activeRowIndex` can
> be connected to a Node's `enabled` plug to disable the node when
> no row is matched.
