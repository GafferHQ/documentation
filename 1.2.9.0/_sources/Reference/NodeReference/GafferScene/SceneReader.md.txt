SceneReader
===========

The primary means of loading external assets (models, animation and cameras etc)
from caches into Gaffer. Gaffer's native file format is the .scc (SceneCache) format
provided by Cortex, but Alembic and USD files are also supported. Other formats may be
added by registering a new implementation of Cortex's abstract SceneInterface.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs
an empty scene.

fileName
--------

The name of the file to be loaded. The file can be
in any of the formats supported by Cortex's SceneInterfaces.

**Supported file extensions** : abc, lscc, scc, usd, usda, usdc, usdz, vdb

refreshCount
------------

May be incremented to force a reload if the file has
changed on disk - otherwise old contents may still
be loaded via Gaffer's cache.

tags
----

Limits the parts of the scene loaded to only those
with a specific set of tags.

transform
---------

The transform used to position the cache. This is applied to
all children of the cache root.
