radius
------

Radius of the sphere.

zMin
----

Limits the extent of the sphere along the lower pole.
Valid values are in the range [-1,1] and should always
be less than zMax.

zMax
----

Limits the extent of the sphere along the upper pole.
Valid values are in the range [-1,1] and should always
be greater than zMin.

thetaMax
--------

Limits the extent of the sphere around the pole axis.
Valid values are in the range [0,360].

divisions
---------

Controls tesselation of the sphere when type is Mesh.
