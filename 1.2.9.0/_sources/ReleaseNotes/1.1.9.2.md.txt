Fixes
-----

- Tweak nodes : Fixed bugs which prevented the creation of new tweaks when an existing tweak had an input connection.
- Preferences : Fixed bug which caused UI metadata to be serialised unnecessarily into `~/gaffer/startup/gui/preferences.py`.
- OpenGL Texture shader : Fixed bug which allowed transparent regions to obscure objects behind them.
- Viewer :
  - Fixed visualisation of Arnold `image` nodes with non-default UV Coordinates settings.
  - Fixed Arnold selection bugs caused by the `ai:fis_filter` option.
