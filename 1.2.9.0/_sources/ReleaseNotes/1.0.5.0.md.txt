1.0.5.0
=======

Features
--------

- Rename : Added a new node for renaming scene locations ([#1201](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1201)).
- LookTransform : Added a new node for applying OpenColorIO looks to images.

Improvements
------------

- SplinePlug : Added `Constant` interpolation mode.
- SceneReader : Added reading of more Alembic GeomParam types. Specifically `unsigned char`, `uint16`, `int16` and `uint32` GeomParams are loaded as `UCharVectorData`, `UShortVectorData`, `ShortVectorData` and `UIntVectorData` PrimitiveVariables respectively.
- SceneWriter : Added writing of more Alembic GeomParam types, mirroring the improved reading mentioned above.
- Light Editor : Added the ability to select linked objects and to delete lights. Both commands can can be accessed by right-clicking a light name and selecting either 'Select Linked Objects' or 'Delete'.
- Graph Editor : When changing the root of the Graph Editor (such as entering or exiting a Box), framing is now restored specifically for the current Graph Editor. Previously, a single framing history was used for all Graph Editors.

Fixes
-----

- GraphEditor : Fixed handling of errors on `Dot.labelType` and `Dot.label` plugs.
- EditScope : Fixed mislocated plug nodules when connecting a new `EditScope` to a `BoxIn`, `BoxOut` or `Box` node.
- Backdrop : Fixed bug selecting or moving a backdrop when zoomed out in the GraphEditor, where drag-resizing the top edge was incorrectly being given precedence.
- CDL : Fixed handling of values for the `direction` plug. Previously, `OCIO::TransformDirection` enum values were being used directly as plug values, but OpenColorIO 2 broke compatibility by changing the enum. A new `GafferImage::CDL::Direction` enum provides stable values for use in the `CDL.direction` plug, insulating Gaffer from future changes.
- ViewPlugValueWidget :
  - Fixed bug which caused images to be evaluated in the wrong context.
  - Fixed error handling bug which could prevent the NodeEditor from building.
- CropWindowTool :
  - Fixed bug which caused images to be evaluated in the wrong context.
  - Fixed bug handling images with non-default views.
- Cycles : Fixed rendering with a non-default crop window.
- Arnold : Fixed handling of closure shader connections in USD materials exported from Maya.

Build
-----

- Cortex : Updated to 10.4.2.1.
