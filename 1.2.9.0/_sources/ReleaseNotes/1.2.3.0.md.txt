1.2.3.0
=======

Features
--------

- Arnold : Added support for Arnold 7.2.
- PointsToLevelSet : Added a new node for converting points primitives into OpenVDB level sets.

Improvements
------------

- ArnoldOptions : Exposed Arnold 7.2.1.0's Global Light Sampling feature via a new `lightSamples` plug.
- ArnoldAttributes : Added `shadowAutoBumpVisibility` plug, since Arnold 7.2.1.0 now correctly implements this feature.
- Shader : Added support for shading input connections to splines. After double clicking on a spline to open the editor, you may select a control point, and then drag an input to the value control. Works in GafferImage, GafferObject and Arnold. Supports a max of 32 values in the spline.
- FloatSpline and ColorSpline OSL shaders : Added a `direction` parameter, with options of `U`, `V`, `Diagonal`, `Radial` and `Custom`.
- Constraint : Disabled the `referenceFrame` plug in the NodeEditor when `keepReferencePosition` is off.

Fixes
-----

- OSLObject/OSLImage : Fixed missing `+` buttons in GraphEditor on Windows ([#5222](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5222)).
- Viewer : Fixed missing VDB visualisations on Windows ([#5223](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5223)).
- SceneReader : Fixed reading of USD primitives containing `primvars:normals`. These are now correctly loaded as a primitive variable called N, taking precedence over the UsdGeomPointBased normals attribute.
- SceneWriter : Fixed writing of indexed normals to USD files, so that the indexing is retained on load. Note that this means that normals are now always written as `primvars:normals` and never via the UsdGeomPointBased `normals` attribute.
- CompoundDataPlugValueWidget : Fixed bug which prevented the addition of new plugs when an existing plug had an input connection. This affected the ContextVariables, CustomOptions and CustomAttributes nodes, among others.

API
---

- NoduleLayout : Added a warning message when a required custom gadget has not been registered.
- GafferUITest.TestCase : Added testing of NodeGadgets to `assertNodeUIsHaveExpectedLifetime()`.
- SceneView : Added Python binding for `resolutionGate()` method.
- ViewportGadget : Added Python binding for `RasterScope` class.
- OSLShader : Added support for `visibleExpression` and `enabledExpression` metadata in OSL shaders. These may provide an OSL expression to control the activation of parameters in Gaffer's node editor.

Build
-----

- Cortex : Updated to version 10.4.7.0.
