1.2.5.0
=======

Improvements
------------

- SceneReader : Improved performance when computing bounds for complex USD stages containing scenegraph instancing.

Fixes
-----

- SceneReader :
  - Fixed rounding errors which could cause the wrong sample to be read from a USD file. This was particularly noticeable for non-interpolable attributes such as visibility.
  - Fixed transforms loaded from USD files using the `UsdGeomXformable::ResetXformStack` operator.
- SceneWriter : The UsdShadeMaterialBindingAPI schema is now applied to all prims with material bindings, making the written files compatible with `USD_SHADE_MATERIAL_BINDING_API_CHECK=strict` mode.

Build
-----

- Cortex : Updated to version 10.4.7.1.
