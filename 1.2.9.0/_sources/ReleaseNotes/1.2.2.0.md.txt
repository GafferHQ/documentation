1.2.2.0
=======

Improvements
------------

- Playback :
  - Added <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd> hotkey toggle for forward playback.
  - Added <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Left</kbd> hotkey toggle for backward playback.
  - Pressing either of <kbd>Right</kbd> or <kbd>Left</kbd> will also stop playback.
- Transform Tools : Added <kbd>O</kbd> shortcut to cycle through the orientation modes.

Fixes
-----

- Reference : Fixed bug reloading a Reference after changing the number of points in a SplinePlug. The complete edited spline is now maintained across a reload. If the spline has not been edited, then the value is updated from the `.grf` file as before ([#5170](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5170)).
- DispatchDialogue : Fixed `AttributeError: '__Implementation' object has no attribute 'message'` error.
- Catalogue : Fixed errors caused by empty image selections.
- MultiLineStringPlugValueWidget : Fixed bug handling <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
- PathListingWidget : Fixed issue with columns set to automatically stretch not resizing if column headers are hidden.
- Viewer : Fixed bugs which could prevent an object from being updated if its computation was previously interrupted.

Documentation
-------------

- Updated the "Assembling The Gaffer Bot" tutorial to use Cycles instead of Appleseed.
