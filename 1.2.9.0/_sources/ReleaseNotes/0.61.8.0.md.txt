0.61.8.0
========

Improvements
------------

- Profiling menu :
  - Added menu item to start the ContextMonitor for all nodes, not just the selected one.
  - Added "Clear Caches" menu item.

Fixes
-----

- ArnoldRender : Fixed volume motion rendering by setting `options.reference_time`. This had been broken by changes in Arnold `7.0.0.3`, but Arnold `7.1.0.0` or later is required for the fix to work.
- NameValuePlug : Fixed bug where making a connection by drag and drop would connect the `name` plug as well as `enabled` and `value`. This caused confusion because making connections like `overscanLeft -> overscanRight` on the StandardOptions node meant that _both_ plugs ended up specifying the left overscan option.
