1.2.1.0
=======

Features
--------

- SetEditor : Added a new editor UI for inspecting sets. This can be found in the tab next to the SceneInspector in the Standard layouts. Sets are displayed hierarchically using ":" characters in set names as separators.
- ImageToPoints : Added a new node for converting images to points primitives.
- MeshSplit : Added node for splitting a mesh into multiple meshes based on the values of a primitive variable. May be combined with the recently added MeshSegments to split meshes into connected parts.

Improvements
------------

- USD : Added translation of UsdUVTexture's `scale`, `bias` and `fallback` parameters to Arnold.
- StringPlugValueWidget : Added support for converting StringVectorData values pasted or dropped onto the widget. The string value is formed by joining the string array using spaces.
- Spreadsheet : Improved support for converting StringVectorData to StringData when dropping values on cells. The string value is formed by joining the string array using spaces.
- CompoundPathFilter : Canceller is now passed to member filters.
- PathListingWidget : Improved performance when sorting items based on the name column.
- Scene : Improved performance computing the bounding box for a primitive.
- aiQuadLight : Added `width` and `height` parameters.

Fixes
-----

- Locale :
  - Reintroduced `LC_NUMERIC=C` environment variable assignment to wrapper. This was removed in `1.2.0.0` but is still necessary due to a [bug in Cortex](https://github.com/ImageEngine/cortex/issues/1338).
  - Fixed serialisation of `.gfr` files in locales with non-default numeric formatting ([#5158](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5158)).
- Tweak nodes : Fixed bugs which prevented the creation of new tweaks when an existing tweak had an input connection.
- Preferences : Fixed bug which caused UI metadata to be serialised unnecessarily into `~/gaffer/startup/gui/preferences.py`.
- OpenGL Texture shader : Fixed bug which allowed transparent regions to obscure objects behind them.
- Viewer :
  - Fixed visualisation of Arnold `image` nodes with non-default UV Coordinates settings.
  - Fixed Arnold selection bugs caused by the `ai:fis_filter` option.
- SceneReader : Invalid primitive variables in USD files are now skipped during loading, with a warning being emitted instead.
- DeleteFaces : Fixed sudivision crease handling bug.
- USD RectLight : Fixed the orientation of textures applied to the light to be oriented with the top-left of the image at the top-left of the quad light when viewed from an object receiving illumination.

Documentation
-------------

 - Added more Python examples to the Scripting Reference "Common Operations" article.
 - Added instructions for installing and configuring Gaffer on Windows to the "Getting Started" guide.

API
---

- RGBAChannelsPlugValueWidget : Added support for `rgbaChannelsPlugValueWidget:allowNone` metadata.
