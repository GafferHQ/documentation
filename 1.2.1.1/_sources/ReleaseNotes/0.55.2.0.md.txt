0.55.2.0
========

Features
--------

- Spreadsheet ([#3222](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3222)) : Added a new node to simplify workflows where different settings are needed in different contexts. A common expected use is to collapse the "many identical branches per shot" pattern into a single branch and a Spreadsheet. Spreadsheets also integrate well with the PathFilter and CollectScenes nodes to provide values on a per-location basis.

Improvements
------------

- Stats app : Added `-postLoadScript` command line argument. This can be used to perform post-processing of the loaded script before stats are gathered.
- Appleseed : Added the ability to hide Appleseed nodes and other presets from the UI by setting the `GAFFERAPPLESEED_HIDE_UI` environment variable to `1`. Appleseed will still be available for OSL shader previews and example scenes.
- StringPlug : Added support for the `${scene:path}` variable in string substitutions.

Fixes
-----

- CollectScenes : Fixed bug in set computations. This first appeared as a failure to display lights in the viewer in certain circumstances ([#3497](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3497)).
- Viewer : Fixed X-Ray shading mode on MacOS ([#3473](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3473)).
- Caching : Changed the cache used in various sub-systems to avoid potential compute failures ([#3476](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3476)).
- LRUCache : Fixed handling of cases where value computation for a cache-miss was cancelled in-flight, which then prevented the value ever being successfully retrieved ([#3469](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3469)).
- Menu : Fixed spacing issue in menus when the first item was a labelled divider.
- ShaderTweaks : Fixed missing preset for Arnold Blockers.
- Arnold : Fixed crash when disconnecting shader networks from lights ([#3484](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3484)).
- VectorDataWidget : Fixed styling update bug for non-editable widgets.

API
---

- NameValuePlugValueWidget : Added `set/getNameVisible()` methods.
- PresetsPlugValueWidget : Added a `menu()` accessor method.
