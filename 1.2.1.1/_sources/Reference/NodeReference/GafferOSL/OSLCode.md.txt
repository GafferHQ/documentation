OSLCode
=======

Allows arbitrary OSL shaders to be written directly within
Gaffer.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

attributeSuffix
---------------

Suffix for the attribute used for shader assignment.

parameters
----------

The inputs to the shader. Any number of inputs may be created
by adding child plugs. Supported plug types and the corresponding
OSL types are :

- FloatPlug (`float`)
- IntPlug (`int`)
- ColorPlug (`color`)
- V3fPlug (`vector`)
- M44fPlug (`matrix`)
- StringPlug (`string`)
- ClosurePlug (`closure color`)
- SplinefColor3f ( triplet of `float [], color [], string` )

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

out
---

The outputs from the shader. Any number of outputs may be created
by adding child plugs. Supported plug types are as for the input
parameters, with the exception of SplinefColor3f, which cannot be
used as an output.

code
----

The code for the body of the OSL shader. This should read from the
input parameters and write to the output parameters.
