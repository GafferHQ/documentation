0.57.3.0
========

Fixes
-----

- Viewer : Fixed a bug in the render control widget which caused the entire Viewer to fail if there was an error computing the metadata for an image.
- Arnold : Added workaround for Arnold bug which prevented interactive edits to quad light colour textures.
- CopyAttributes : Fixed bugs triggered by non-existent source locations. CopyAttributes now matches the behavior of CopyPrimitiveVariables : if the source location does not exist, nothing is copied and no error is caused.
- Viewer : Fixed bugs in the "Edit Tweaks..." menu item. The wrong ShaderTweaks node could be displayed for certain upstream configurations of nodes like CopyAttributes, ShuffleAttributes and MergeScenes.
- OSLCode : Removed string substitutions on code, so that symbols such as `#` can be used directly. Substitutions were of no use anyway, because they were not being applied in a suitable context.
- SceneAlgo : Fixed `shaderTweaks()` bugs that could cause the wrong node to be returned.

API
---

- SceneAlgo : Added an `attributeHistory()` method which returns a computation history for one specific attribute.
