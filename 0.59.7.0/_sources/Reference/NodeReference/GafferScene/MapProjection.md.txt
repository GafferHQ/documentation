MapProjection
=============

Applies texture coordinates to meshes via a camera projection.
In Gaffer, texture coordinates (commonly referred to as UVs)
are represented as primitive variables.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

camera
------

The location of the camera to use for the projection.

position
--------

The primitive variable that provides the position to be
used in the projection.

uvSet
-----

The name of the primitive variable used to store the
projected UV coordinates. This may be changed to store
multiple sets of UVs on a single mesh.
