ParentConstraint
================

Constrains objects from one part of the scene hierarchy as if they were
children of another part of the hierarchy.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

targetScene
-----------

The scene containing the target location to which objects are
constrained. If this is unconnected, the main input scene
is used instead.

target
------

The scene location to which the objects are constrained.
The world space transform of this location forms the basis
of the constraint target, but is modified by the targetMode
and targetOffset values before the constraint is applied.

ignoreMissingTarget
-------------------

Causes the constraint to do nothing if the target location
doesn't exist in the scene, instead of erroring.

targetMode
----------

The precise location of the target transform - this can be
derived from the origin or bounding box of the target location.

targetOffset
------------

An offset applied to the target transform before the constraint
is applied. The offset is measured in the object space of the
target location.

relativeTransform
-----------------

Transforms the constrained object relative to the target location.
