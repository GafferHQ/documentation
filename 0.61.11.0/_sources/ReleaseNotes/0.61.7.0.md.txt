0.61.7.0
========

Improvements
------------

- Arnold : Added support for Arnold 7.1.
- SubTree : Added `inheritTransform`, `inheritAttributes` and `inheritSetMembership` plugs.

Fixes
-----

- ArnoldRender : Fixed crash caused by lights with a non-existent shader.
- TransformTool : Fixed glitch that could cause a more distant handle to be drawn on top of a closer one.
- CameraTool : Fixed bug which allowed a parent of the camera to be moved, instead of the camera itself. This was particularly evident when looking through a camera loaded from a SceneReader, where the entire scene would be moved unexpectedly.
