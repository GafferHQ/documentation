Fixes
-----

- Expression : Fixed OSL expression parsing bug triggered by plug names which were
  prefixes of other plug names. This caused a very confusing `Syntax error: syntax error`
  error.
- ExtensionAlgo :
  - Fixed copy/paste of nodes exported by ExtensionAlgo ([#3886](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3886)).
  - Fixed bug which prevented the use of internal Expression nodes.
