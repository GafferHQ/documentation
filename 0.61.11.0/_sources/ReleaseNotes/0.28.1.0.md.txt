UI
--

- The 3D Viewer can now look through lights ([#1846](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1846)).
- Prefixed NodeMenu search text for RSL and OSL shaders with ri and osl respectively ([#1850](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1850)).

Arnold
------

- Added support for trace sets ([#1847](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1847)). Any standard gaffer set with a name beginning with "render:" will be exported to Arnold as a trace set.
- Fixed ArnoldDisplacement crash ([#1849](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1849)).
- Added support for a `gaffer.nodeMenu.category` metadata value to customise the shader menu ([#1850](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1850)).

Scene
-----

---

- Context ([#1848](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1848))
  - Added GIL release in `set()` method bindings to
    fix potential deadlocks.
  - Fixed bug which meant that `remove()` wasn't
    emitting `changedSignal()`.
- SceneAlgo
  - Added `sets()` overload to compute a subset of all sets.
- RendererAlgo (preview)
  - Added RenderSets utility class.
  - Modified output methods to take a RenderSets argument.
- ShaderPlug
  - Fixed bug involving plugs with no input ([#1849](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1849)).
