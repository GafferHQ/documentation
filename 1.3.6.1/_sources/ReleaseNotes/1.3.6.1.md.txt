Fixes
-----

- Catalogue : Fixed bugs which caused additional images to appear when changing light groups or crop in an Arnold render ([#4267](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/4267), [#4633](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/4633)).
- Instancer :
  - Fixed failure to update encapsulated instancers when prototype properties changed during interactive renders.
  - Prevented unnecessary updates for encapsulated instancers when prototype globals changed.

- Shader : Added support for reading from USD `token` attributes in `<attr:>` string parameter substitutions.
