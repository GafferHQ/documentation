1.0.6.2
=======

Fixes
-----

- GraphEditor : Fixed crash when focussing an empty ContextVariables, NameSwitch or Loop node ([#4944](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/4944)).
- UI :
  - Fixed tooltips containing raw HTML.
  - Fixed stalls caused by Qt repeatedly accessing the same icon files.
- Viewer : Fixed context used to compute the view menu for the image being shown. On the first update, an empty context was being used instead of the script's context.
- DocumentationAlgo : Fixed handling of raw HTML by `markdownToHTML()`.
- Reference : Fixed unnecessary serialisation of connections from internal plugs to external plugs. These are serialised in the `.grf` file already, so do not need to be duplicated on the Reference node itself. This bug prevented changes to the internal connections from taking effect when reloading a modified `.grf` file, and could cause load failures when the connections were from an internal Expression ([#4935](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/4935)).
- MeshToLevelSet, LevelSetOffset : Fixed bug that could cause partial results to be returned if a previous operation was cancelled.
- PlugValueWidget : Fixed unnecessary updates when calling `setContext()` with the same context.
