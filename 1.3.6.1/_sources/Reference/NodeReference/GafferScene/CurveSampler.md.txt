CurveSampler
============

Samples primitive variables from parametric positions on some
source curves. The positions are specified using the index of
the curve and its `v` parameter.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to determine which objects in the
`in` scene will receive primitive variables sampled
from the `sourceLocation` in the `source` scene.

adjustBounds
------------

Adjusts bounding boxes to account for the changes made to the object.

> Caution : Adjusting boundings boxes has a performance penalty.
> If you do not need accurate bounds or you know that the bounds
> will only change slightly, you may prefer to turn this off.

source
------

The scene that contains the source primitive that
primitive variables will be sampled from.

sourceLocation
--------------

The location of the primitive in the `source` scene that
will be sampled from.

primitiveVariables
------------------

The names of the primitive variables to be sampled from the source
primitive. These should be separated by spaces and can use Gaffer's
standard wildcards to match multiple variables. The sampled variables
are prefixed with `prefix` before being added to the sampling object.

prefix
------

A prefix applied to the names of the sampled primitive variables before
they are added to the sampling object. This is particularly useful when
sampling something like "P", and not not wanting to modify the true
vertex positions of the sampling primitive.

status
------

The name of a boolean primitive variable created to record the success or
failure of the sampling operation.

curveIndex
----------

The name of an integer primitive variable that specifies the index of
the curve to be sampled. If left unspecified, the first curve will be sampled.

v
-

The name of a float primitive variable that specifies the parametric
position on the curve to be sampled. A value of 0 corresponds to
the start of the curve, and a value of 1 corresponds to the end.
If left unspecified, a value of 0 is used.

> Note : Values outside the `0-1` range are invalid and cannot
> be sampled. In this case, the `status` output primitive variable
> will contain `False` to indicate failure.
