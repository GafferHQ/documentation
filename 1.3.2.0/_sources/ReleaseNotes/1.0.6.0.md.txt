1.0.6.0
=======

Improvements
------------

- Constraint :
  - Added `maintainReferencePosition` plug. This allows the constraint to maintain the original position of the object at a specifed reference time.
  - Improved performance for UV constraints where the target has static geometry but an animated transform. One such benchmark shows a greater than 40x speedup.

Fixes
-----

- Shape : Fixed unnecessary serialisation of internal connection.
- ScaleTool :
  - Fixed oversensitive scaling when zoomed out in the Viewer.
  - Prevented uniform scaling from becoming negative.
