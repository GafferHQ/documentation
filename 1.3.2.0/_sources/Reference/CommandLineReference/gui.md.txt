gui
===

A graphical user interface for editing node graphs. This is
the primary user facing Gaffer application.

-help
-----

Prints names and descriptions of each parameter rather than running the application.

-threads
--------

The maximum number of threads used for computation. The default value of zero matches the number of threads to the available hardware cores. Negative values specify a thread count relative to the available cores, leaving some in reserve for other applications. Positive values specify the thread count explicitly, but are clamped so it does not exceed the available cores.

-profileFileName
----------------

If this is specified, then the application is run using the cProfile profiling module, and the results saved to the file for later examination.

-scripts
--------

A list of scripts to edit.

-fullScreen
-----------

Opens the UI in full screen mode.
