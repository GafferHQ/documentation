browser
=======

A file browser with the ability to preview
images and caches using Gaffer's viewers. This
is the same as the Browser panel from the main
gui application, but running as a standalone
application.

-help
-----

Prints names and descriptions of each parameter rather than running the application.

-threads
--------

The maximum number of threads used for computation. The default value of zero matches the number of threads to the available hardware cores. Negative values specify a thread count relative to the available cores, leaving some in reserve for other applications. Positive values specify the thread count explicitly, but are clamped so it does not exceed the available cores.

-profileFileName
----------------

If this is specified, then the application is run using the cProfile profiling module, and the results saved to the file for later examination.

-initialPath
------------

The path to browse to initially
