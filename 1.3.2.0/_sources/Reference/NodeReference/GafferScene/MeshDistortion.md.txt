MeshDistortion
==============

Measures how much a mesh has been distorted from a reference shape.
The distortion is calculated by comparing edge lengths between the
reference and deformed shapes. Compressed areas have negative distortion
values, stretched areas have positive distortion values, and areas with
no deformation have distortion values of zero. The calculated distortion
is output as primitive variables on the mesh.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

position
--------

The name of the primitive variable which contains the deformed vertex
positions for the mesh.

referencePosition
-----------------

The name of the primitive variable which contains the undeformed vertex
positions for the mesh.

uvSet
-----

The name of the primitive variable which contains the UV set used to
calculate UV distortion.

distortion
----------

The name of the primitive variable created to store the distortion
values. This will contain a float per vertex.

uvDistortion
------------

The name of the primitive variable created to store the UV distortion
values. This will contain a V2f with separate distortion values for the
U and V directions.
