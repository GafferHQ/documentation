0.1.0.0
=======

#### Apps

- The "gui" app now tolerates errors when loading scripts from the command line. Note that currently errors are only reported to the shell.
- The "execute" app can now handle nodes inside Boxes.

#### Core

- Improved version numbering ([#980](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/980))
	- Versions are now MILESTONE.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
		- Changes to MILESTONE version denote major development landmarks
		- Changes to MAJOR version denote backwards incompatible changes
		- Changes to MINOR version denote new backwards compatible features
		- Changes to PATCH version denote bug fixes
	- Added Gaffer.About.compatibilityVersion() method
	- Added GAFFER_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION macro for conditional compilation of C++ extensions
- Fixed bug whereby GraphComponent::setName() could allow duplicate names
- Dispatcher improvements
	- `Dispatcher::postDispatchSignal()` is now always executed, even if execution is cancelled or fails. A new boolean argument is passed to specify whether or not dispatch succeeded.
	- Dispatcher now creates job directories automatically, so derived classes don't have to

#### Incompatible changes

- `Dispatcher::postDispatchSignal()` signature change.
- Dispatcher jobDirectory() semantics change.
- Dispatcher jobDirectoryPlug() -> jobsDirectoryPlug() rename.

#### Build

- Requires Cortex 9.0.0-a5
