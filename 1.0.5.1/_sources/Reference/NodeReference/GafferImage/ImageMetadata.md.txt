ImageMetadata
=============

Adds arbitrary metadata entires to an image. If those entries
already exist in the incoming image metadata, their values
will be overwritten.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image

metadata
--------

The metadata to be applied - arbitrary numbers of user defined metadata may be added
as children of this plug via the user interface, or using the CompoundDataPlug python API

extraMetadata
-------------

Additional metadata to be added, specified within a single
`IECore.CompoundObject`. This is convenient when using an expression
to define the metadata and when the number of items might be
dynamic. It can also be used to create options whose type cannot be
handled by the `metadata` CompoundDataPlug.

If the same option is defined by both the `metadata` and the
`extraMetadata` plugs, then the value from the `extraMetadata` is
taken.
