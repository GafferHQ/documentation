========

Features
--------

- ArnoldOptions : Added settings for enabling GPU rendering ([#3076](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3076)).

Improvements
------------

- GraphEditor : Added navigation items to the connection context menu. These allow
  quick navigation to the source or destination node ([#3064](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3064)).
- SceneInspector : Added fields for subdivision creases and corners ([#3067](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3067)).

Fixes
-----

- Render : Fixed bug which prevented non-SceneNodes (for instance, Switches or
  ContextVariables nodes) from rendering ([#3061](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3061)).
- ValuePlug : Fixed GIL management bugs. These were most visible in a hang caused
  by toggling exposure in the ImageView while background processing was being performed ([#3068](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3068)).
- SceneInspector : Fixed drag and drop of PrimitiveVariables ([#3067](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3067)).
- Instancer ([#3072](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3072)) :
  - Fixed crashes caused by duplicate ids. Duplicates are now ignored.
  - Fixed child ordering to be ascending by id.
- GraphEditor : Fixed bug drawing auxiliary connections to sizeless parent nodules ([#3069](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3069)).
