0.58.3.0
========

Improvements
------------

- Preferences : Added support for OpenColorIO context variables. These may contain references to Gaffer context variables via the standard `${variable}` syntax, but please note that such variables are only available in the Viewer and not in the rest of the UI (for instance, colour swatches and pickers).
- Viewer : Increased the size of transform tool handle hit areas.
- Arnold : Moved debug log messages into the Debug severity and added support for Memory and Timestamp options.

Fixes
-----

- Node Editor : Fix bug in section decoration when a plug was set to its user default.
- ErrorDialogue : Fixed extremely slow display of warning and error messages. This was particularly apparent when showing errors that occurred while opening files.
- Viewer : Fixed Default display transform so that it updates correctly when the default is changed via the Preferences dialogue, and when the context changes.
- UVView : Fixed a performance regression vs 0.57 when displaying many UDIM textures.
- OpDialogue, DispatchDialogue, ErrorDialogue : Fixed missing filtering controls for progress messages.
- Encapsulate : Fixed bug where globals and render sets were evaluated in the wrong context.
- OSLObject : Fixed invalid reads from Constant array primitive variables.
- PresetsPlugValueWidget/PlugValueWidget : Fixed bugs handling context-sensitive presets.

API
---

- MessageWidget : `setMessages()` now also accepts messages in the format used by IECore.CapturingMessageHandler.
- WidgetAlgo : Added `keepUntilIdle()` method.
- OpenColorIOTransform : Added `processor()` and `processorHash()` public methods.
