dispatch
========

Dispatches task nodes such as ImageWriters, SystemCommands and Render nodes,
either from within an existing .gfr file or by creating a script on the fly.
This differs from the execute app in that it performs a full dispatch via a
dispatcher, rather than executing a single task node.

Example usage :

```
gaffer dispatch -script comp.gfr -tasks ImageWriter1 -dispatcher Local -settings -dispatcher.frameRange '"1001-1020"'

gaffer dispatch -script comp.gfr -tasks ImageWriter1 -gui -show ImageWriter1 -dispatcher Local -settings -dispatcher.frameRange '"1001-1020"'

gaffer dispatch -gui -tasks GafferDispatch.SystemCommand -dispatcher Local -settings -SystemCommand.command '"ls -l"'
```

-help
-----

Prints names and descriptions of each parameter rather than running the application.

-threads
--------

The maximum number of threads used for computation. The default value of zero causes the number of threads to  be chosen automatically based on the available hardware.

-profileFileName
----------------

If this is specified, then the application is run using the cProfile profiling module, and the results saved to the file for later examination.

-gui
----

Determines whether a gui is presented prior to dispatching or the tasks are dispatched directly.

-script
-------

An optional script containing the task network to be dispatched.

-ignoreScriptLoadErrors
-----------------------

Causes errors which occur while loading the script to be ignored. Not recommended.

-applyUserDefaults
------------------

Applies userDefault values to all nodes and plugs created by the app. Note if a script is supplied, the nodes will be unaffected.

-tasks
------

The names of the task nodes to dispatch. Note if a script is supplied, the tasks must exist within the script. If no script is supplied, the task nodes will be constructed on the fly and added to a default script.

-show
-----

A list of nodes to display when running the gui. This parameter has no effect unless the gui is loaded.

-dispatcher
-----------

The type of dispatcher to use for the dispatch. A new dispatcher of this type will be created, with userDefaults applied.

-alternateDispatchers
---------------------

A list of alternate dispatcher types to make available when running the gui. This parameter has no effect unless the gui is loaded.

-settings
---------

The values to be set on the nodes, dispatcher, or context. Values should be in the format -nodeA.plugA value -nodeA.plugB value -nodeB.plugC value -dispatcher.plugD value -LocalDispatcher.plugE value -context.entry value
