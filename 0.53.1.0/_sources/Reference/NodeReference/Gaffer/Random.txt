Random
======

Generates repeatable random values from a seed. This can be
very useful for the procedural generation of variation.
Numeric or colour values may be generated.

The random values are generated from a seed and a context
variable - to get useful variation either the seed or the
value of the context variable must be varied too.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

seed
----

Seed for the random number generator. Different seeds
produce different random numbers. When controlling two
different properties using the same context variable,
different seeds may be used to ensure that the generated
values are different.

contextEntry
------------

The most important plug for achieving interesting variation.
Should be set to the name of a context variable which will
be different for each evaluation of the node. Good examples
are "scene:path" to generate a different value per scene
location, or "frame" to generate a different value per frame.

floatRange
----------

The minimum and maximum values that will be generated for the
outFloat plug.

outFloat
--------

Random floating point output derived from seed, context variable
and float range plugs.

baseColor
---------

Used as the basis for the random colours generated for the
outColor plug. All colours start with this value and then
have a random HSV variation applied, using the ranges specified
below.

hue
---

The +- range over which the hue of the base colour is varied.

saturation
----------

The +- range over which the saturation of the base colour is varied.

value
-----

The +- range over which the value of the base colour is varied.

outColor
--------

Random colour output derived from seed, context variable, base
colour, hue, saturation and value plugs.
