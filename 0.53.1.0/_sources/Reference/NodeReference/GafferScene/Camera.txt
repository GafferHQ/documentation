Camera
======

Produces scenes containing a camera. To choose which camera is
used for rendering, use a StandardOptions node.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs
an empty scene.

name
----

The name of the object in the output scene.

sets
----

A list of sets to include the object in. The
names should be separated by spaces.

transform
---------

The transform applied to the object.

projection
----------

The basic camera type.

perspectiveMode
---------------

You can control the view of a perspective camera using either a field of view ( which
is a simple angle ), or as an aperture and focal length ( more natural for people who
are used to physical cameras ).  In either case, the view will be stored on the camera
as a focal length and aperture, but you can set or adjust it either way.

fieldOfView
-----------

The horizontal field of view, specified in degrees.  When using a perspective projection
with "Field Of View" control mode, this will control the focal length.

apertureAspectRatio
-------------------

When using "Field Of View" control mode, the vertical field of view is controlled by
maintaining this aspect ratio of the aperture.  The default value of 1 means that the
horizontal and vertical field of view are the same.

Note that the final field of view of a render from this camera will depend both on the
camera settings, but also the resolution and film fit mode in the render settings.

aperture
--------

When using "Aperture and Focal Length" control mode, this defines the X and Y dimensions
of the aperture.

Note that in CG applications, "Film Back" and aperture are used interchangeably - lenses
are treated as perfectly symmetric boxes, with the aperture at the front the same size
as the film back would be in a physical camera.

Once you have aperture set to match a physical camera, you can use focal length to
control the field of view, the same as you would with a physical camera.

The units of aperture do not matter, as long as you use the same units for focal length.
( By convention, millimeters ).

A set of presets are provided matching some of the cameras frequently used as references,
and some common cameras which are currently used, or you can use "Custom" to choose your
own.

Note that the final field of view of a render from this camera will depend both on the
camera settings, but also the resolution and film fit mode in the render settings.

focalLength
-----------

When using "Aperture and Focal Length" control mode, this defines the physical focal
length of the camera.  This allows controlling the field of view using the same units
used for physical cameras ( as long as your aperture is set appropriately in matching
units ).

orthographicAperture
--------------------

When using an orthographic projection, this defines the world space extent of the
camera frustum in X and Y.

apertureOffset
--------------

Create a skewed camera frustum by offsetting the aperture.  The offset is measured in
aperture units.  In "Field Of View" control mode, the horizontal field of view is 1
aperture unit.  In "Aperture and Focal Length" control mode, the aperture units match
the aperture setting.  For an orthographic camera, aperture units are world space units.

Only useful in special cases such as emulating a tilt-shift lens, rendering tiles for
a large panorama, or matching plate images which have been asymmetrically cropped.

fStop
-----

Setting a non-zero fStop will enable focal blur in renderers that support it.

fStop specifies ratio of focal length divided by lens aperture.

A higher fStop reduces the lens aperture, producing less blur.

focalLengthWorldScale
---------------------

To use fStop to compute the lens aperture, we need to know focal length in world units.
Since we usually store focal length in millimeters to match how we refer to real focal lengths
and apertures, we need to know how to scale focal length into world units.

We default to a value of 0.1, which scales from millimeters to centimeters.  This matches
the default world units of Alembic and USD.  If your world units are decimeters or meters,
then pick the corresponding option instead.

If you are controlling the camera using a field of view instead of focal length, then the
default aperture is just 1.  You should pick "Custom" and then pick a scale that matches
a realistic aperture size ( ie. 0.036 meters )

focusDistance
-------------

When rendering with focal blur, focusDistance defines the world distance at which
objects are in perfect focus.

clippingPlanes
--------------

The near and far clipping planes, defining the range over which objects are visible
to this camera.

renderSettingOverrides
----------------------

Render settings specified here will override the global render settings.

renderSettingOverrides.filmFit
------------------------------

Override the "filmFit" render option.  
Determines how the size of the rendered image relates to the camera aperture. If the aspect
ratios of the aperture and the output resolution are the same, then this has no effect,
otherwise it dictates what method is used to preserve the pixel aspect ratio of the rendered
image.

Horizontal
:   The frustum is adjusted so that the rendered image fills the full
        width of the aperture and aspect ratio is preserved.

Vertical
:   The frustum is adjusted so that the rendered image fills the full
        height of the aperture and aspect ratio is preserved.

Fit
:   Automatically picks Horizontal or Vertical such that all of the aperture is contained
        within the output image. This may result in seeing outside the aperture at the top and
        bottom or left and right.

Fill
:   Automatically picks Horizontal or Vertical such that the output image is fully covered by
        the aperture. Part of the aperture may be cropped off at the top and bottom or left and
        right.

Distort
:   Distorts the frustum so that the aperture is fitted exactly to the output display window,
        resulting in non-square pixels

renderSettingOverrides.shutter
------------------------------

Override the "shutter" render option.  The interval over which the camera shutter is
open.  Measured in frames, and specified relative to the frame being rendered.

renderSettingOverrides.resolution
---------------------------------

Override the "renderResolution" render option.  The resolution of the image to be rendered.

renderSettingOverrides.pixelAspectRatio
---------------------------------------

Override the "pixelAspectRatio" render option.  The aspect ratio (x/y) of the pixels in
the rendered image.

renderSettingOverrides.resolutionMultiplier
-------------------------------------------

Override the "resolutionMultiplier" render option.  Multiplier applied to the render
resolution.

renderSettingOverrides.overscan
-------------------------------

Override the "overscan" render option.  Adds extra pixels to the sides of the rendered
image.  This can be useful when camera shake or blur will be added as a post process.
This plug just enables overscan as a whole - use the overscanTop, overscanBottom,
overscanLeft and overscanRight plugs to specify the amount of overscan on each side of
the image.

renderSettingOverrides.overscanLeft
-----------------------------------

Override the "overscanLeft" render option.  The amount of overscan at the left of the
image. Specified as a 0-1 proportion of the original image height.

renderSettingOverrides.overscanRight
------------------------------------

Override the "overscanRight" render option.  The amount of overscan at the right of the
image. Specified as a 0-1 proportion of the original image height.

renderSettingOverrides.overscanTop
----------------------------------

Override the "overscanTop" render option.  The amount of overscan at the top of the
image. Specified as a 0-1 proportion of the original image height.

renderSettingOverrides.overscanBottom
-------------------------------------

Override the "overscanBottom" render option.  The amount of overscan at the bottom of the
image. Specified as a 0-1 proportion of the original image height.

renderSettingOverrides.cropWindow
---------------------------------

Override the "renderCropWindow" render option. Limits the render to a region of the
image. The rendered image will have the same resolution as usual, but areas outside
the crop will be rendered black. Coordinates range from 0,0 at the top left of the
image to 1,1 at the bottom right. The crop window tool in the viewer may be used to
set this interactively.

renderSettingOverrides.depthOfField
-----------------------------------

Override the "depthOfField" render option.  Forces depth of field to always ( or never )
be rendered.  To get depth of field, you must also set an appropriate f-stop on this
camera.
