MeshTangents
============

Adds surface tangent primitive variables to the mesh using the specified positions and UVSet. 

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

uvSet
-----

Name of the UV set primitive variable used to calculate uTangent & vTangent.

position
--------

Name of the primitive variable which contains the position data used calculate tangents & binormals. 
For example 'Pref' would compute tangents using the reference positions (if defined)

uTangent
--------

Name of the primitive variable which will contain the uTangent data. 

vTangent
--------

Name of the primitive variable which will contain the vTangent data. 

orthogonal
----------

Adjusts vTangent to be orthogonal to the uTangent.
