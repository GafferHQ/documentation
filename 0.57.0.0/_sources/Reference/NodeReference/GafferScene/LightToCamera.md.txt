LightToCamera
=============

Converts lights into cameras. Spotlights are converted to a perspective
camera with the field of view matching the cone angle, and distant lights are
converted to an orthographic camera.

should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

How the aperture gate (the frame defined by the aperture) will
fit into the resolution gate (the framed defined by the data
window). Fitting is applied only if the respective aspect
ratios of the aperture and the resolution are different. The
following fitting modes are available:

- _Horizontal:_ The aperture gate will fit horizontally between
the left/right edges of the resolution gate, while preserving
its aspect ratio. If the aperture's aspect ratio is larger than
the resolution's, the top/bottom edges of the aperture will be
cropped. If it's smaller, then the top/bottom edges will
capture extra vertical scene content. 
- _Vertical:_ The aperture gate will fit vertically between the
top/bottom edges of the resolution gate, while preserving its
aspect ratio. If the aperture's aspect ratio is larger than the
resolution's, the left/right edges of the aperture will be
cropped. If it's smaller, then the left/right edges will
capture more horizontal scene content.
- _Fit_: The aperture gate will fit horizontally (like
_Horizontal_ mode) or vertically (like _Vertical_ mode) inside
the resolution gate to avoid cropping the aperture, while
preserving its aspect ratio. If the two gates' aspect ratios
differ, the aperture will capture extra horizontal or vertical
scene content.
- _Fill:_ The aperture gate will fill the resolution gate such
that none of the aperture captures extra scene content, while
preserving its aspect ratio. In other words, it will make the
opposite choice of the _Fit_ mode. If the two gates' aspect
ratios differ, the aperture will be horizontally or vertically
cropped. 
- _Distort:_ The aperture gate will match the size of the
resolution gate. If their aspect ratios differ, the resulting
image will appear vertically or horizontally stretched or
squeezed.
