CollectScenes
=============

Builds a scene by bundling multiple input scenes together, each
under their own root location. Instead of using an array of inputs
like the Group node, a single input is used instead, and a Context
Variable is provided so that a different hierarchy can be generated
under each root location. This is especially powerful for building
dynamic scenes where the number of inputs is not known prior to
building the node graph.

Since merging globals from multiple scenes often doesn't make sense,
the output globals are taken directly from the scene corresponding to
`rootNames[0]`.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

rootNames
---------

The names of the locations to create at the root of
the output scene. The input scene is copied underneath
each of these root locations.

Often the rootNames will be driven by an expression that generates
a dynamic number of root locations, perhaps by querying an asset
management system or listing cache files on disk.

rootNameVariable
----------------

The name of a Context Variable that is set to the current
root name when evaluating the input scene. This can be used
in upstream expressions and string substitutions to generate
a different hierarchy under each root location.

sourceRoot
----------

Specifies the root of the subtree to be copied from the input
scene. The default value causes the whole scene to be collected.

The rootName variable may be used in expressions and string
substitutions for this plug, allowing different subtrees to be
collected for each root name in the output.
