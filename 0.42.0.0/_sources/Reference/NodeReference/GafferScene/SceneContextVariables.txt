SceneContextVariables
=====================

Adds variables which can be referenced by upstream expressions
and string substitutions.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

variables
---------

The variables to be added. Each variable is represented
as a child plug, created either through the UI or using the
CompoundDataPlug API.

extraVariables
--------------

An additional set of variables to be added. Arbitrary numbers
of variables may be specified within a single IECore::CompoundData
object, where each key/value pair in the object defines a variable.
This is convenient when using an expression to define the variables
and the variable count might be dynamic.

If the same variable is defined by both the variables and the
extraVariables plugs, then the value from the extraVariables
is taken.
