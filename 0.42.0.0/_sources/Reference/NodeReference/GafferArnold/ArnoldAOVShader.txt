should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

The input scene

This suffix defines where the aov shader is stored in the render options. If you use
an existing suffix, you will overwrite instead of creating a new AOV shader.
