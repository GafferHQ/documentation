0.59.8.0
========

Features
--------

- Viewer : Added multiple color inspectors. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+click on an image
  to create a pixel inspector, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+drag to create an area
  inspector. The image footer now shows the results from all your inspectors,
  and allows you to add or delete them.
- FilterQuery : Added a new node for querying the results of a filter at a specific location.
- GraphEditor : Added "Annotate..." item to the node context menu. This can be configured with
  multiple annotation templates using the `MetadataAlgo` API.

Improvements
------------

- Set : Added `setVariable` plug to allow the input filter to be varied depending on the set name.
- TabbedContainer : Added menu button to allow selection of tabs that are not
  visible due to a lack of horizontal space.

Fixes
-----

- Arnold : Fixed rendering of encapsulated objects for which automatic instancing
  is not possible. Examples include curves with non-zero `ai:curves:min_pixel_width`
  and meshes with non-zero `ai:polymesh:subdiv_adaptive_error`.
- PlugValueWidget : Fixed bug that tried to update the widget before all graph edits were complete.
- GraphEditor : Fixed framing of nodes dropped into the editor. This was incorrect when the editor was
  not at the default zoom.
- OSL Constant : Fixed usage as a surface shader in Arnold.

API
---

- Context :
  - Added forwards compatibility for methods added to provide enhanced
    performance in Gaffer 0.60. This allows the same code to be compiled for
    both Gaffer 0.60 and Gaffer 0.59 (but with only the Gaffer 0.60 build
    benefiting from improved performance).
  - Added support for `IECore::InternedString` variables in `substitute()`.
- MetadataAlgo : Added functions for managing annotations on nodes.
- MonitorAlgo : Added `persistent` argument to `annotate()` functions.
