SetFilter
=========

A filter which uses sets to define which locations are matched.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the filter. When it is off, the
filter does not match any locations.

out
---

The result of the filter. This should be connected into
the "filter" plug of a FilteredSceneProcessor.

setExpression
-------------

A set expression that computes a set that defines
the locations to be matched.

For example, the expression `mySpheresSet | myCubesSet`
will create a set that contains all objects in
`mySpheresSet` and `myCubesSet`.

Gaffer supports the union operator (`|`) as shown in the
example and also provides intersection (`&`) and difference (`-`)
operations for set expressions. Names of locations
can be used to represent a set that contains only
that one location.

In addition, the `in` and `containing` operators can be
used to query descendant and ancestor matches. For example,
`materialA in assetB` will select all locations in the `materialA`
set that are at or below locations in the `assetB` set. This
allows leaf matches to be made against sets that only contain
root or parent locations. `allAssets containing glass` will
selection locations in `allAssets` that have children in the
`glass` set.

For more examples please consult the Scripting Reference
section in Gaffer's documentation.

The context menu of the set expression text field provides
entries that help construct set expressions.
