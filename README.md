# Documentation

This documentation is generated automatically as part of Gaffer's build process, and is copied to this repository only so we can host it on GitHub Pages. Do not edit these pages - they will be overwritten.

# Updating

The `update.py` file will automatically download the documentation from the latest release and add it to the repo. It may be run manually, but `.github/workflows/update.yml` runs it automatically and opens pull requests containing any needed updates.
