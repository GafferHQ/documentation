AttributeTweaks
===============

Makes modifications to attributes.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

localise
--------

Turn on to allow location-specific tweaks to be made to inherited
attributes. Attributes will be localised to locations matching the
node's filter prior to tweaking. The original inherited attributes
will remain untouched.

ignoreMissing
-------------

Ignores tweaks targeting missing attributes. When off, missing attributes
cause the node to error.

tweaks
------

The tweaks to be made to the attributes. Arbitrary numbers of user defined
tweaks may be added as children of this plug via the user interface, or
using the AttributeTweaks API via python.
