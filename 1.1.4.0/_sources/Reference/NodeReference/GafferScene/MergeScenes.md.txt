MergeScenes
===========

Merges multiple input scenes into a single output scene.
Merging is performed left to right, starting with `in[0]`.

By default, when more than one input contains the same
scene location, the location's properties from the leftmost
input are kept. In this mode, only _new_ locations are merged
in from the additional inputs. Optionally, the properties
can be replaced by or merged with the properties of the
subsequent inputs.

Sets are always merged from all inputs. Where multiple inputs
have sets with the same name, the sets are merged into a union.

> Caution : When `transformMode` and/or `objectMode` is not `Keep`,
> bounding box computations have significant overhead. Consider
> not using these operations, or turning off `adjustBounds`.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scenes

transformMode
-------------

The method used to merge transforms when the same location
exists in multiple input scenes. Keep mode keeps the transform
from the first input, and Replace mode replaces it with the
transform of the last input.

attributesMode
--------------

The method used to merge attributes when the same location
exists in multiple input scenes. Keep mode keeps the attributes
from the first input, Replace mode replaces them with the attributes
from the last input, and Merge mode merges all attributes together
from first to last.

objectMode
----------

The method used to merge objects when the same location
exists in multiple input scenes. Keep mode keeps the object
from the first input, and Replace mode replaces it with the
object from the last input which has one.

globalsMode
-----------

The method used to merge scene globals. Keep mode keeps the globals
from the first input, Replace mode replaces them with the globals
from the last input, and Merge mode merges all globals together
from first to last.

adjustBounds
------------

Adjusts bounding boxes to take account of the merging operation.

> Caution : This has considerable overhead when the `objectsMode` and/or
> `transformsMode` is not `Keep`.
