0.54.1.0
========

Features
--------

- Orientation : Added new node for converting between different orientation representations
  (eulers, quaternions, matrices etc). This is particularly useful when preparing points for
  instancing ([#3328](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3328)).

Improvements
------------

- ShaderAssignment : Added support for assigning OSL shaders with an alternative prefix. This
  can be useful when mixing OSL shader assignments with renderer-specific shader assignments
  ([#3334](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3334)).

Fixes
-----

- HierarchyView : Fixed bug which could cause a hang when Shift+clicking to expand ([#3335](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3335)).
- ScriptNode ([#3340](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3340)) :
  - Fixed GIL management bug which could cause crashes when serialising a script.
  - Fixed bug that could cause string substitutions to be baked into serialisations.

API
---

- Improved support for iterating over nodes and plugs ([#3341](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3341)) :
  - Added FilteredChildRange and FilteredRecursiveChildRange classes. These can be used with
    C++11's range-for.
  - Added Iterator, RecursiveIterator, Range and RecursiveRange type aliases to all nodes and
    plugs.
  - Added InputIterator, OutputIterator, RecursiveInputIterator, RecursiveOutputIterator,
    InputRange, OutputRange, RecursiveInputRange and RecursiveOutputRange type aliases to all
    plugs.
  - Exposed Range classes to Python.

Documentation
-------------

- Fixed problems with screenshots for MacOS builds ([#3321](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3321)).
- Made miscellaneous improvements to the examples available from the Help menu ([#3314](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3314)).
