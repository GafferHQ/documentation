0.61.3.0
========

Features
--------

- RandomChoice : Added new node for choosing a random value from a list of weighted choices.
- ArnoldImager : Added new node for adding Arnold imagers to the scene globals.

Improvements
------------

- LightEditor/SceneViewInspector : Improved performance when viewing complex scenes.
- GraphEditor :
  - The focus widget now ignores right clicks, avoiding situations where attempting to open a context menu could accidentally change focus.
  - Removed the focus widget from Expression, Random, Spreadsheet and Animation nodes.
- StandardAttributes : Added `attributes.displayColor` plug, for controlling the colour of objects in the Viewer.
- UI : The UI is now scaled automatically for high-resolution monitors on Linux ([#2157](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2157)). Set the `QT_ENABLE_HIGHDPI_SCALING` environment variable to `0` to disable.
- ArnoldOptions : Added `ignore_imagers` option.

Fixes
-----

- Viewer : Fixed gnomon, which went missing in Gaffer 0.61.0.0.
- PathListingWidget : Fixed hangs triggered by hiding a widget while Python-based columns were being queried.
- VectorDataWidget :
  - Fixed header visibility when `setHeader()` is called after construction.
  - Fixed errors displaying vectors of differing lengths. Note : it is not yet possible to _edit_ vectors of differing lengths.
- PrimitiveInspector :
  - Fixed errors displaying Constant primitive variables with differing array lengths.
  - Fixed header tooltip formatting to match the SceneInspector.
- LightEditor : Fixed column widths. This was only an issue in Qt 5.12 builds, not the official GafferHQ builds.
- USD :
  - Fixed `Failed to load attribute` warnings caused by attributes without an authored value.
  - Fixed loading of Houdini-style paired primitive variables used to represent varying-length-arrays per vertex/face.

API
---

- StandardNodeGadget : Added `nodeGadget:focusGadgetVisible` metadata.
- VectorDataPlugValueWidget :
  - Added support for showing plugs with children, with each child forming a column in the UI.
  - Added `vectorDataPlugValueWidget:elementDefaultValue` metadata, used to provide the initial
    value for newly added rows.

Build
-----

- Cortex : Updated to version 10.3.2.0.
- Arnold : Added source compatibility for Arnold 7.1.
