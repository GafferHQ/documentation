ShuffleAttributes
=================

ShuffleAttributes is used to copy or rename arbitrary numbers of attributes at
the filtered locations. The deleteSource plugs may be used to remove the original
source attribute(s) after the shuffling has been completed.

An additional context variable `${source}` can be used on the destination plugs
to insert the name of each source attribute. For example, to prefix all attributes
with `user:` set the source to `*` and the destination to `user:${source}`.
