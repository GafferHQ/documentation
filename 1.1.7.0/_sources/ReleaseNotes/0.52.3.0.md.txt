0.52.3.0
========

Features
--------

- BleedFill : Added new image node to fill areas with zero alpha by bleeding in colours
  from adjacent image regions ([#2909](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2909)).
- Rectangle : Added new image node to annotate rectangular regions of an image ([#2912](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2912)).

Improvements
------------

- Light linking ([#2875](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2875)) :
  - Added a "defaultLights" set for use in light linking set expressions.
  - Added a "defaultLight" plug to all Light nodes, to control membership in
    the "defaultLights" set.
  - Significantly optimised the processing of light links in Gaffer and in
    the Arnold renderer backend.
- Viewer : "userDefault" metadata can now be used to configure the default settings
  for Views ([#2893](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2893)).
- PythonCommand/SystemCommand : Empty commands are now ignored ([#2896](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2896)).
- SceneWriter : Added support for subclassing in Python ([#2901](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2901)).
- Checkerboard : Improved performance ([#2912](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2912)).

Fixes
-----

- SceneInspector : Fixed bug which caused sections to be disabled ([#2903](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2903)).
- Layout Menu : Fixed clashes between custom layout names and standard menu items. For instance,
  previously you could save a layout called "Delete" and it would mean that the standard "Delete"
  submenu was no longer available ([#2899](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2899)).
- Grade : Fixed bug that caused clamping to be ignored if the other settings were at default
  values ([#2908](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2908)).
- CompoundDataPlug/ValuePlug : Fixed GIL management bugs which could cause Gaffer to hang ([#2907](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2907)).
