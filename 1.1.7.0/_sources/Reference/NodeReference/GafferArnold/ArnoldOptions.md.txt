ArnoldOptions
=============

Sets global scene options applicable to the Arnold
renderer. Use the StandardOptions node to set
global options applicable to all renderers.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

options
-------

The options to be applied - arbitrary numbers of user defined options may be added
as children of this plug via the user interface, or using the CompoundDataPlug API via
python.

options.bucketSize
------------------

Controls the size of the image buckets.
The default size is 64x64 pixels.
Bigger buckets will increase memory usage
while smaller buckets may render slower as
they need to perform redundant computations
and filtering.

options.bucketScanning
----------------------

Controls the order in which buckets are
processed. A spiral pattern is the default.

options.parallelNodeInit
------------------------

Enables Arnold's parallel node initialization.
Note that some Arnold features may not be
thread-safe, in which case enabling this option
can cause crashes. One such example is Cryptomatte
and its use in the AlSurface shader.

options.threads
---------------

Specifies the number of threads Arnold
is allowed to use. A value of 0 gives
Arnold access to all available threads.

options.aaSamples
-----------------

Controls the number of rays per pixel
traced from the camera. The more samples,
the better the quality of antialiasing,
motion blur and depth of field. The actual
number of rays per pixel is the square of
the AA samples value - so a value of 3
means 9 rays are traced, 4 means 16 rays are
traced and so on.

options.giDiffuseSamples
------------------------

Controls the number of rays traced when
computing indirect illumination ("bounce light").
The number of actual diffuse rays traced is the
square of this number.

options.giSpecularSamples
-------------------------

Controls the number of rays traced when
computing specular reflections.
The number of actual specular rays traced
is the square of this number.

options.giTransmissionSamples
-----------------------------

Controls the number of rays traced when
computing specular refractions. The number of actual
transmitted specular rays traced is the square of this number.

options.giSSSSamples
--------------------

Controls the number of rays traced when
computing subsurface scattering. The number of actual
subsurface rays traced is the square of this number.

options.giVolumeSamples
-----------------------

Controls the number of rays traced when
computing indirect lighting for volumes.
The number of actual rays traced
is the square of this number. The volume
ray depth must be increased from the default
value of 0 before this setting is of use.

options.aaSeed
--------------

Seeds the randomness used when generating samples.
By default this is set to the current frame number
so that the pattern of sampling noise changes every
frame. It can be locked to a particular value so
that sampling noise does not change from frame to
frame.

options.aaSampleClamp
---------------------

Sets a maximum for the values of individual pixel samples. This
can help reduce fireflies.

options.aaSampleClampAffectsAOVs
--------------------------------

Applies the sample clamping settings to all RGB and RGBA
AOVs, in addition to the beauty image.

options.indirectSampleClamp
---------------------------

Clamp fireflies resulting from indirect calculations.
May cause problems with dulling highlights in reflections.

options.lowLightThreshold
-------------------------

Light paths with less energy than this will be discarded.  This
saves tracing shadow rays, but cuts off the light when it gets dim.
Raising this improves performance, but makes the image potentially
darker in some areas.

options.enableAdaptiveSampling
------------------------------

If adaptive sampling is enabled, Arnold will take a minimum
of ( aaSamples * aaSamples ) samples per pixel, and will then
take up to ( aaSamplesMax * aaSamplesMax ) samples per pixel,
or until the remaining estimated noise gets lower than
aaAdaptiveThreshold.

> Note : Arnold's adaptive sampling won't do anything if aaSamples == 1 : you need to set aaSamples to at least 2.

options.aaSamplesMax
--------------------

The maximum sampling rate during adaptive sampling.  Like
aaSamples, this value is squared.  So aaSamplesMax == 6 means up to 36 samples per pixel.

options.aaAdaptiveThreshold
---------------------------

How much leftover noise is acceptable when terminating adaptive sampling.  Higher values
accept more noise, lower values keep rendering longer to achieve smaller amounts of
noise.

options.enableProgressiveRender
-------------------------------

Enables progressive rendering, with a series of coarse low-resolution
renders followed by a full quality render updated continuously.

options.progressiveMinAASamples
-------------------------------

Controls the coarseness of the first low resolution pass
of interactive rendering. A value of `-4` starts with 16x16 pixel
blocks, `-3` gives 8x8 blocks, `-2` gives 4x4, `-1` gives 2x2 and
`0` disables the low resolution passes completely.

options.giTotalDepth
--------------------

The maximum depth of any ray (Diffuse + Specular +
Transmission + Volume).

options.giDiffuseDepth
----------------------

Controls the number of ray bounces when
computing indirect illumination ("bounce light").

options.giSpecularDepth
-----------------------

Controls the number of ray bounces when
computing specular reflections.

options.giTransmissionDepth
---------------------------

Controls the number of ray bounces when
computing specular refractions.

options.giVolumeDepth
---------------------

Controls the number of ray bounces when
computing indirect lighting on volumes.

options.autoTransparencyDepth
-----------------------------

The number of allowable transparent layers - after
this the last object will be treated as opaque.

options.maxSubdivisions
-----------------------

A global override for the maximum polymesh.subdiv_iterations.

options.subdivDicingCamera
--------------------------

If specified, adaptive subdivision will be performed
relative to this camera, instead of the render camera.

options.subdivFrustumCulling
----------------------------

Disable subdivision of polygons outside the camera frustum.
( Uses dicing camera if one has been set ).
Saves performance, at the cost of inaccurate reflections
and shadows.

options.subdivFrustumPadding
----------------------------

When using subdivFrustumCulling, adds a world space bound
around the frustum where subdivision still occurs.  Can be
used to improve shadows, reflections, and objects the motion
blur into frame.

options.textureMaxMemoryMB
--------------------------

The maximum amount of memory to use for caching
textures. Tiles are loaded on demand and cached,
and when the memory limit is reached the least
recently used tiles are discarded to make room
for more. Measured in megabytes.

options.texturePerFileStats
---------------------------

Turns on detailed statistics output for
each individual texture file used.

options.textureMaxSharpen
-------------------------

Controls the sharpness of texture lookups,
providing a tradeoff between sharpness and
the amount of texture data loaded. If
textures appear too blurry, then the value
should be increased to add sharpness.

The theoretical optimum value is to match the
number of AA samples, but in practice the
improvement in sharpness this brings often
doesn't justify the increased render time and
memory usage.

options.textureUseExistingTx
----------------------------

Automatically uses a `<filename>.tx` file if it exists, in
preference to a `<filename>.jpg` (or any other file format) that has
been specified. Particularly useful when used with
`textureAutoGenerateTx`, which will automatically create the `.tx`
file as necessary.

> Info : The `.tx` file format provides improved performance and
reduced memory usage, because it contains mip-mapped textures.

options.textureAutoGenerateTx
-----------------------------

Automatically generates a `<filename>.tx` when given
`<filename>.jpg` (or any other file format). Requires that
`textureUseExistingTx` is also turned on. By default, textures
are generated in the same folder as the source texture. Use
`textureAutoTxPath` to specify an alternative destination.

> Caution : This feature might cause problems if multiple render
farm nodes are trying to convert the same textures in the same
target folder at the same time, resulting in potential crashes,
corrupt textures, and poor performance.

options.textureAutoTxPath
-------------------------

Specifies an alternate destination folder for textures generated
by `textureAutoGenerateTx`.

options.gpuMaxTextureResolution
-------------------------------

If non-zero, this will omit the high resolution mipmaps when in GPU mode, to avoid running out of GPU memory.

extraOptions
------------

An additional set of options to be added. Arbitrary numbers
of options may be specified within a single `IECore.CompoundObject`,
where each key/value pair in the object defines an option.
This is convenient when using an expression to define the options
and the option count might be dynamic. It can also be used to
create options whose type cannot be handled by the `options`
CompoundDataPlug.

If the same option is defined by both the `options` and the
`extraOptions` plugs, then the value from the `extraOptions`
is taken.
