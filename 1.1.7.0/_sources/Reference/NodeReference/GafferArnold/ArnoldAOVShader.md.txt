ArnoldAOVShader
===============

Sets up global shaders in the Arnold options which can be used to populate global AOVs.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

shader
------

The shader to be assigned. This will be stored as an
option within the scene globals.

optionSuffix
------------

This suffix defines where the aov shader is stored in the render options. If you use
an existing suffix, you will overwrite instead of creating a new AOV shader.
