DeleteObject
============

Deletes the object at a location, keeping the location itself
intact. This is most useful when a location contains an unwanted object,
but the location also has children which need to be preserved.

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

The input scene

processed. A Filter node should be connected here.
