should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

The input scene

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

shader

The shader to be assigned.

connected to the `shader` plug will be used instead.
