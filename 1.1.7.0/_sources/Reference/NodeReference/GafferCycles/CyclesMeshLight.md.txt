CyclesMeshLight
===============

Turns mesh primitives into Cycles mesh lights by assigning
an emission shader, turning off all visibility except for camera rays,
and adding the meshes to the default lights set.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

cameraVisibility
----------------

Whether or not the mesh light is visible to camera
rays.

lightGroup
----------

The light group that the mesh light will contribute to.

parameters
----------

The parameters of the Cycles emission shader that
is applied to the meshes.

parameters.color
----------------

Refer to Cycles's documentation of the emission
shader.

parameters.strength
-------------------

Refer to Cycles's documentation of the emission
shader.

defaultLight
------------

Whether this light illuminates all geometry by default. When
toggled, the light will be added to the "defaultLights" set, which
can be referenced in set expressions and manipulated by downstream
nodes.
