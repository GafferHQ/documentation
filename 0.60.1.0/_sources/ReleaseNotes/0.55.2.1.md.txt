Fixes
-----

- Viewer : Improved clipping plane "Fit ..." command logic to avoid clipping the scene when dollying in, or bad framing using <kbd>f</kbd>.
- Spreadsheet :
  - Fixed bug with column name text input dialog.
  - Fixed problems when adding or removing columns on promoted spreadsheets.
  - Fixed plug promotion via `BoxIO.promote()`.
- TransformTool : Fixed editing of transforms specified by promoted Spreadsheets.
- GraphGadget : Fixed bug which could cause a node to be shown under the wrong parent when its gadget type was changed.
- USD : Added workaround for custom builds which omit the `pxr.Usd` Python module. In this case USD support will be disabled.
- NumericWidget : Fixed bug that caused an exception to be raised if the up/down keys were pressed in a NumericWidget when the widget's value was empty.
