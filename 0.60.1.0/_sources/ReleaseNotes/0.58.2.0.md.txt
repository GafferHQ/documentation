0.58.2.0
========

Improvements
------------

- CollectScenes : Added support for collecting at roots of arbitrary depth.
- AttributeVisualiser : Added support for V2f, V3f, V2i, V3i, V2d and V3d data types.
- Node Editor : Added decoration to collapsed sections when any of their children have non-default values.
- HierarchyView : Added <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> shortcut/context menu action to copy the selected paths to the clipboard.
- UI : Added support for basic math operators (`+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `%`) in numeric fields.

Fixes
-----

- PrimitiveInspector :
  - Fixed bug that caused data lists to lose their scroll position during updates.
  - Fixed bug that could cause the inspector to show a different location to other Editors.
  - Fixed bug when the selected location doesn't exist in the input scene.
- Attributes : Fixed bug that could prevent interactive updates when the `global` plug was on.
- CollectScenes : Fixed childNames hashing bug.
- NodeAlgo : Fixed bug that caused `isSetToUserDefault()` to return `True` when the plug's input was from a ComputeNode.
  Like `ValuePlug::isSetToDefault()`, `isSetToUserDefault()` will now never trigger a compute, and all computed inputs
  are treated as non-default.
- GafferArnold : Added missing GafferOSL Python bindings import.
- Plug : Fixed bug that could break IPR updates following a node graph edit ([#3911](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3911)).
- Viewer : Fixed CropWindow tool reset button size.

API
---

- OpenImageIOReader : Added methods for controlling the maximum number of images files to keep open at one time.
