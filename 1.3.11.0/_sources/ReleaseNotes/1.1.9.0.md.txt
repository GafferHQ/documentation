1.1.9.0
=======

Improvements
------------

- Arnold : Disabled ADP more thoroughly, using `ARNOLD_ADP_DISABLE=1` for Arnold 7.1.4.0 and greater. Set `ARNOLD_ADP_DISABLE=0` before running Gaffer if you wish to use ADP.
- Cycles :
  - Added warning when a shader contains a parameter which does not exist in Cycles.
  - Added warning when a shader contains a parameter with an unsupported datatype.
  - Added warning when a shader contains an enum parameter with an invalid value.
  - Added support for passing InternedStringData to enum and string parameters.

Fixes
-----

- Backups : Fixed error when a backup file contained characters that couldn't be represented using the current locale. This could be triggered by a separate bug in OpenShadingLanguage that caused the locale to be changed unnecessarily ([#5048](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5048)).
- Viewer :
  - Fixed crash when switching from Cycles to OpenGL rendering ([#5051](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5051)).
  - Fixed potential crash when destroying a raytraced viewport.
- Cyles :
  - Fixed crashes caused by providing unsupported data types in shader parameters.
  - Fixed support for Color4f values on colour shader parameters. This can be useful when loading non-standard USD files.
  - Fixed support for V[23]i values on vector shader parameters.
  - Fixed handling of colour array parameters.

API
---

- TestCase : Added `scopedLocale()` method.
