1.2.10.4
========

Fixes
-----

- GraphEditor : Removed dynamic raster-space sizing of focus icon, as it caused excessive overlap with other nodes at certain zoom levels and on certain high resolution displays ([#5435](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5435)).
- StringPlugValueWidget : Fixed bug handling <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
- Arnold : Fixed unnecessary `opaque` attribute deprecation warnings. These are now only emitted in the case that `opaque` has been explicitly turned off.
- ShaderUI : Fixed bug causing identical but independent shaders in a shader network from being included in the shader browser.
