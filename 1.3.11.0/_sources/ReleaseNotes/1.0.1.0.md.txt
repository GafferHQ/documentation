1.0.1.0
=======

Improvements
------------

- TweakPlug : Added new tweak modes.
  - Min : Resulting value will be the lesser of the existing value and the tweak value. For values with multiple components, such as `Color3f`, each component is compared individually.
  - Max : Same as `Min` except the resulting value is the greater of the existing value and the tweak value.
  - ListAppend : Values in the tweak list are added to the end of the existing list. If a value is in both the existing list and the tweak list, it is removed from the existing list before being added.
  - ListPrepend : Same as `ListAppend` except the tweak list is added to the beginning of the existing list.
  - ListRemove : Values in the tweak list are removed from the existing list.
- Added horizontal scroll bars to the Light Editor, Scene Inspector and Shader Browser when their content is too wide to fit within the widget.
