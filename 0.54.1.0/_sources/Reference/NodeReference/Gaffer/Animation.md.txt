Animation
=========

Generates keyframed animation to be applied to plugs
on other nodes.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

curves
------

Stores animation curves. Rather than access
these directly, prefer to use the Animation::acquire()
method.
