LevelSetToMesh
==============

Converts a level set VDB object to a mesh primitive .

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

grid
----

Name of the level set grid to create a mesh primitive from.

isoValue
--------

Value which defines the isosurface to convert to a mesh primitive. 
Usually this is set to zero but setting a small positive number will generate a dilated mesh and negative will create an eroded mesh. 

adaptivity
----------

Adaptively generate fewer polygons from level set. 0 - uniform meshing, 1 - maximum level of adaptivity.
