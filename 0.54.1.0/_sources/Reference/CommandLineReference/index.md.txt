Command Line Reference
======================

The `gaffer` command is an application loader used to run
any of the applications shipped with gaffer, or any extension
apps installed in directories specified by the `GAFFER_APP_PATHS`
environment variable.

A gaffer command takes this general form :

```
gaffer appName -arg value -arg value ...
```

If the `appName` is not specified it defaults to `"gui"`, and
the familiar main interface is loaded. This shortcut also allows
a file to load to be specified :

```
gaffer file.gfr
```

Help for any application can be printed with the following
command :

```
gaffer -help appName
```

Further information on the specific command line arguments for each
application is provided below.
