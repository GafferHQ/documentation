ContextQuery
============

Queries variables from the current context, creating outputs for each variable.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

queries
-------

The context variables to be queried - arbitrary numbers of context
variables may be added as children of this plug via the user interface,
or via python. Each child is a `NameValuePlug` whose `name` plug is
the context variable to query, and whose `value` plug is the default
value to use if the variable does not exist in the context with an
appropriate type.

out
---

The parent plug of the query outputs. The order of outputs corresponds
to the order of children of `queries`.
