0.77.0
======

- Added alignment support and addSpacer method to ListContainer.
- Fixed an update bug in the pixel value inspector ([#401](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/401)).
- Added the pinned status to saved layouts ([#444](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/444)).
- Added read-only mode to NodeUIs and NodeEditor ([#414](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/414)). Note that this currently interacts poorly with activators on RenderManShader node, and will be fixed in a future release.
- Fixed read-only MultiLineTextWidget bugs.
- Implemented tag reading in SceneReader node. Tags are represented as BoolData attributes called "user:tag:tagName" ([#494](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/494)).
- Increased width of plug labels in NodeEditor ([#98](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/98)).
- Improved the default layout to include SceneHierarchy and SceneInspector and Timeline editors.
- Fixed TabbedContainer sizing when tabs not visible.
- Fixed crashes when loading old scripts where coshader array parameters were stored as Compound plugs.
- Fixed propagation of shader hashes through Boxes.
- Allowed shaders to accept inputs from Boxes, even if the Box doesn't currently output a shader.
- Changed internal image coordinate system to have 0,0 at bottom left (formerly at top left).
