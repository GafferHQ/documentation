LookTransform
=============

Applies OpenColorIO "looks" to an image.

A 'look' is a named color transform, intended to modify the look of an
image in a 'creative' manner (as opposed to a colorspace definition which
tends to be technically/mathematically defined).

Examples of looks may be a neutral grade, to be applied to film scans
prior to VFX work, or a per-shot DI grade decided on by the director,
to be applied just before the viewing transform.

OCIOLooks must be predefined in the OpenColorIO configuration before usage,
often reference per-shot/sequence LUTs/CCs and are applied in scene linear colorspace.

See the look plug for further syntax details.

See opencolorio.org for look configuration customization examples.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image

channels
--------

The names of the channels to process. Names should be
separated by spaces and can use Gaffer's standard
wildcards.

processUnpremultiplied
----------------------

Unpremultiplies data before processing, and premultiply again after processing.  This allows
accurate processing of nodes that deal with color, when running on partially transparent or
deep images.
