1.0.2.0
=======

Improvements
------------

- TweakPlug : Using the `ListAppend` and `ListPrepend` modes to add to a non-existent list now creates a list with the new values. Using the `ListRemove` mode to modify a non-existent list results in a non-existent list. All other modes retain their current `missingMode` behavior.
- ImageWriter : The `openexr.dataType` plug now accepts an expression or spreadsheet input to set per-channel data types.

Fixes
-----

- ImageWriter : Fixed bug with color transform alpha handling when the alpha channel was not the last channel.
- Viewer : Fixed images not displaying when the display window was offscreen.
- UV Inspector : Fixed texture display (broken in 1.0.0.0).
- Animation : Prevented negative zero slope.
- Animation Editor :
  - Fixed glitch when dragging a tangent having an opposite tangent with (+/-) inf slope.
  - Fixed bug that caused exception to be raised when the parent node of an editable curve was removed.
  - Fixed bug that prevented signals from being disconnected when a key was deleted.
