===========

----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image

mode
----

Defines how the views listed in the views
plug are treated. Delete mode deletes the listed
views. Keep mode keeps the listed views,
deleting all others.

views
-----

The names of the views to be deleted (or kept
if the mode is set to Keep). Names should be separated
by spaces and may contain any of Gaffer's standard
wildcards.

Note that if you delete all views from an image, you will
be unable to evaluate attributes of the image,  because it
will have no data left.
