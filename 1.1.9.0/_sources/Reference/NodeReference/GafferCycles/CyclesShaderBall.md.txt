CyclesShaderBall
================

Generates scenes suitable for rendering shader balls with Cycles.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs
an empty scene.

shader
------

The shader to be rendered.

resolution
----------

The resolution of the shader ball image, which
is always a square.

environment
-----------

An environment map used for lighting. Should be in latlong
format.

device
------

Device(s) to use for rendering.
To specify multiple devices, there's a few examples under presets.

To render on CPU and the first CUDA device:

        CPU CUDA:00

To render on the first and second OpenCL device:

        OPENCL:00 OPENCL:01

To render on every OptiX device found:

        OPTIX:*

To render on everything found (not recommended, 1 device may have multiple backends!)

        CPU CUDA:* OPTIX:* OPENCL:*

threads
-------

The number of threads used by Cycles to render the
shader ball. A value of 0 uses all cores, and negative
values reserve cores for other uses - to be used by
the rest of the UI for instance.

shadingSystem
-------------

Shading system.

- OSL : Use Open Shading Language (CPU rendering only).
- SVM : Use Shader Virtual Machine.
