0.55.1.0
========

Improvements
------------

- Stats app : Added node compute counts to performanceMonitor script annotations.
- UIEditor :
  - Made the Plugs tab resize the editor window so the Presets section is fully visible when expanded.
  - Added options to the Node tab to turn on and off Box node plug creator decorations.

Fixes
-----

- Viewer : Fixed light filter visualisation.
- ArnoldLightFilter : Fixed bug which caused animated light blockers to lose their transform.
- NodeEditor : Fixed bug that allowed drag and drop to create unwanted input connections to output plugs.
- GraphComponent : Fixed bug that allowed construction with an invalid name ([#3436](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3436)).
- Layouts : Keyboard shortcuts will now work in detached panels restored with a layout.
- Rotate/TranslateTool : Fixed a potential crash if targeted mode was used with an empty selection.
- RotateTool : Fixed a bug when applying targeted mode rotations that introduced arbitrary roll around the z-axis ([#3439](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3439)).
- TabbedContainer : Fixed a bug that caused an exception when the last tab in a container was closed.
- ArnoldLight : Fixed a bug that prevented OSL shaders being used with Arnold lights.
- GraphEditor : Fixed several bugs and a crash that could occur when a parent of the editor's root node was changed or deleted.
- Parent : Fixed bug which prevented loading of Parent nodes with a promoted `children` plug ([#3464](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3464)).
- Group/Parent : Fixed processing of invalid input sets. This now omits the invalid set members rather than throwing an error.
- ImageReader : Fixed bug which meant that changes to the default format were not respected.
- UVInspector : Fixed bug which prevented alternative UV sets from being viewed.
- SceneInspector : Fixed bug comparing objects where a particular primitive variable existed on only one of the objects ([#3432](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3432)).
