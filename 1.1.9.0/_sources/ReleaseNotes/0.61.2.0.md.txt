0.61.2.0
========

Features
--------

- LightEditor : Added a new editor UI for inspecting and editing lights. This can be found in the tab next to the GraphEditor in the standard layouts.
- Cryptomatte : Added a new node to output a matte generated from IDs selected from Cryptomatte AOVs.
- USD : Added support for reading and writing shader assignments via UsdShade.

Improvements
------------

- NodeEditor : Added embedded colour choosers for all colour plugs. These can be shown and hidden by clicking on the slider icon.
- Spreadsheet/SceneViewInspector : Added embedded colour choosers to popup editor windows.
- CopyPrimitiveVariables : Added `prefix` plug, which applies a prefix to the names of the copied primitive variables.
- Rendering : Added `gaffer:version` metadata to the headers of all rendered images.
- PathListingWidget : Added subtle lines between columns.
- SceneViewInspector :
  - Updated to align colour scheme and interaction patterns with the LightEditor.
  - Reduced overhead when the Viewer is not visible in the UI.
- Spreadsheet : Improved interaction with read-only spreadsheets. Previously it was impossible to switch between sections or scroll the cells ([#4529](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/4529)).
- Focus Node : Added <kbd>Alt+1</kbd>-<kbd>Alt+9</kbd> hotkeys for setting focus to a bookmark (also available in the "Edit/Assign Focus" menu).

Fixes
-----

- PathListingWidget :
  - Fixed the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> shortcut for selecting all visible paths. This was broken since Gaffer 0.61.0.0.
  - Fixed the deprecated `getSelectedPaths()` and `getExpandedPaths()` methods in the case that the PathListingWidget's root isn't `/` ([#4510](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/4510)).
- NodeEditor : Fixed subtle label alignment differences between plugs with default and non-default values.
- Instancer : Fixed RootsPerVertex mode in the case that the input object has no vertices. Previously an empty `prototypeRoots` variable would cause an unnecessary error in this case, which was incompatible with the output from DeletePoints.
- Viewer/HierarchyView : Fixed "Edit Source" operation when the source node is inside a Reference. Previously the Reference node was shown, but now the node itself will be (albeit in read-only form).
- ValuePlugSerialiser : Fixed crash if `valueRepr()` was called with a CompoundObject value and a null `serialisation`.
- Button : Fixed bug triggered by calling `setImage()` from within a `with widgetContainer` block.
- ArnoldRender : Stopped instancing of polygon meshes when both `ai:subdivide_polygons` and adaptive subdivision are on.
- GLWidget : Fixed bug which made overlays unresponsive on high resolution displays.
- CropWindowTool : Fixed bug (introduced in 0.61.0.0) which prevented the free drawing of a new crop region outside the current one ([#4530](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/4530)).
- SceneViewInspector : Fixed excessive memory usage when viewing complex scenes.

API
---

- PlugPopup : Added new class for editing plugs in a popup window.
- ColorChooserPlugValueWidget : Added a new class to allow colours to be edited directly using a ColorChooser.
- ColorChooser : Added `setSwatchesVisible()` and `getSwatchesVisible()` methods.
- PathColumn : Added new class for adding custom columns to PathListingWidget.
- CatalogueUI :
  - Column subclasses may now define background colours and tooltips.
  - Deprecated IconColumn class.
- ShaderView : Added `deregisterRenderer()` method.

Build
-----

- Cortex : Updated to version 10.3.2.0.
