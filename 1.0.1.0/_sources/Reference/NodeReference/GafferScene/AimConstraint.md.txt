AimConstraint
=============

Transforms objects so that they are aimed at
a specified target.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

targetScene
-----------

The scene containing the target location to which objects are
constrained. If this is unconnected, the main input scene
is used instead.

target
------

The scene location to which the objects are constrained.
The world space transform of this location forms the basis
of the constraint target, but is modified by the targetMode
and targetOffset values before the constraint is applied.

ignoreMissingTarget
-------------------

Causes the constraint to do nothing if the target location
doesn't exist in the scene, instead of erroring.

targetMode
----------

The precise location of the target transform - this can be
derived from the origin, bounding box or from a specific primitive
uv coordinate or vertex id of the target location.

targetUV
--------

UV coordinate used in "UV" target mode.
The node will error if the specified uv coordinate is out of range or does not map unambiguously
to a single position on the primitive's surface unless ignoreMissingTarget is true.

targetVertex
------------

Vertex id used in "Vertex" target mode.
The node will error if the specified vertex id is out of range unless ignoreMissingTarget is true.
The node will error if the specified primitive does not have a set of uvs named "uv" with
FaceVarying or Vertex interpolation unless ignoreMissingTarget is true. The uvs will be used to
construct a local coordinate frame.

targetOffset
------------

An offset applied to the target transform before the constraint
is applied. The offset is measured in the object space of the
target location unless the target mode is UV or Vertex in which case
the offset is measured relative to the local surface coordinate frame.

aim
---

The aim vector, specified in object space. The
object will be transformed so that this vector
points at the target.

up
--

The up vector, specified in object space. The
object will be transformed so that this vector
points up in world space, as far as is possible.
