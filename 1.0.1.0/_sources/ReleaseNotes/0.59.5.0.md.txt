0.59.5.0
========

Improvements
------------

- Viewer : Added "Light Links" submenu with "Select Linked Lights" and "Select Linked Objects"
  operations.
- FileMenu : File loading and saving no longer locks the UI, and can be cancelled.
- MapProjection : Added `position` plug to allow a custom position to be used for the projection.
- Spreadsheet :
  - Added `resolvedRows` output plug, containing the resolved cell values
    for all active rows. This allows expressions to work with all the data in the spreadsheet,
    independently of the `selector` mechanism.
  - Added <kbd>+</kbd> button for adding new columns directly. Existing plugs may be dragged on
    to it and new plugs can be created from a popup menu.
- CustomOptions : Added `extraOptions` plug to facilitate the creation of dynamic numbers of options
  from a single expression.
- Outputs : Added `motionvector` preset for Arnold.

Fixes
-----

- Instancer : Fixed crash evaluating `variations` when there are no prototypes.
- ArnoldRender : Fixed rendering with `StandardOptions.sampleMotion` off. This now controls Arnold's `options.ignore_motion_blur` parameter, where previously it set the shutter duration to `0`.
- EventLoop : Fixed rare failures in `executeOnUIThread()`. Symptoms included a failure to display
  updates from interactive renders.
- Prune : Fixed bounds computation in the case that the filter claims to match descendants that don't
  exist. A common cause was the usage of `...` or a non-existent path in a PathFilter.
- ImageGadget : Fixed bug which prevented `stateChangedSignal()` from being emitted when
  `setPaused( false )` was called.
- InteractiveRender : Fixed error handling during render startup. Errors are now shown in the render
  log and the terminal output.
- ShaderView : Pausing the viewer now stops the renderer.
- Expression : Fixed OSL expression parsing bug triggered by plug names which were
  prefixes of other plug names. This caused a very confusing `Syntax error: syntax error`
  error.
- ExtensionAlgo :
  - Fixed copy/paste of nodes exported by ExtensionAlgo ([#3886](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3886)).
  - Fixed bug which prevented the use of internal Expression nodes.

API
---

- BackgroundTaskDialogue : Added a new modal dialogue to assist in running tasks in the background.
- EventLoop : Added `BlockedUIThreadExecution` context manager.
- ScriptNode : Added support for cancellation of execution and serialisation.
- ValuePlug : Improved warning emitted if cached value has unexpected type.
- SceneAlgo : Added `linkedLights()` and `linkedObjects()` functions.
- ImageView : Added `imageGadget()` accessor.
