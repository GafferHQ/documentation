Median
======

Applies a median filter to the image. This can be useful for
removing noise.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image

radius
------

The size of the filter in pixels. This can be varied independently
in the x and y directions.

boundingMode
------------

The method used when the filter references pixels outside the
input data window.

expandDataWindow
----------------

Expands the data window to include the external pixels
which the filter radius covers.

masterChannel
-------------

If specified, this channel will be used to compute the pixel index to select for all
channels.  You would probably want to use this with a channel that represents the overall
luminance of the image.  It will produce a rank filter which is lower quality, but preserves
additivity between channels, and is a bit faster.
