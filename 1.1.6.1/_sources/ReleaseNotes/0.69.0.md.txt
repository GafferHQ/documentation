0.69.0
======

* Implemented drag and drop between plugs in the NodeEditor ([#285](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/285))
    Drags are initiated on the label for the plug.
    Left drag initiates a drag for connecting plugs.
    Shift-left drag and middle drag initiate a drag for transferring values between plugs.
    Colours may now also be dragged from the viewer onto a plug.
    There are custom pointer icons for each type of drag ([#44](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/44))
* Added blinking indication for plugs preventing the opening of a colour picker ([#185](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/185)).
* Implemented enabling/disabling for shader nodes ([#327](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/327)).
    By default disabled shaders behave as if their output connections didn't exist.
    RenderMan shaders may act as a pass-through by defining a "primaryInput" annotation naming an input coshader parameter.
* LinkedScene files (.lscc) are now previewable in the browser
* ImageReader only reads the necessary channel from the OpenImageIO cache
* Reverted non-gui ExecutableRender::execute() to block until the render is complete ([#353](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/353)).
* Fixed Nuke link error
* Fixed browser op mode
* Fixed missing Recent Files bug ([#378](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/378)).
* Fixed some bugs with extraneous dragBegins
* Removed namespace prefixes from typenames for displaying to the user ([#389](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/389)).
* Removed deperecated ModelCacheSource
