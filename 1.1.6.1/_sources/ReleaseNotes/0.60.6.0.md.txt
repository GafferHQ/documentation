0.60.6.0
========

Improvements
------------

- Viewer : Added <kbd>PgDn</kbd> and <kbd>PgUp</kbd> hotkeys for switching to the previous and next image layer respectively.
- Shader : Added "label" blindData which should be used in preference to "gaffer:nodeName" blindData.
- ShaderAssignment : Added `label` plug to optionally override the shader's "label" blindData.

Fixes
-----

- Fixed crash that could be triggered by exceptions being thrown during parallel evaluation. This could potentially happen while rendering Instancers where some locations were invalid.
