DeepToFlat
==========

Converts a deep image into a "flat" image, by compositing all samples in
each pixel, resulting in an image with 1 sample for every pixel.

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

Turns the node on and off.

The input image data.

depthMode
---------

Controls the contents of the output depth channels.  "Depth Range" outputs the
minimum and maximum depth values of any sample in the pixel as Z and ZBack.
"Filtered Depth" outputs just a Z channel with the average depth for the pixel,
based on the alpha values of the samples.  "None" outputs no Z or ZBack channel.
