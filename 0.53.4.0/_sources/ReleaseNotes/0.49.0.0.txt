0.49.0.0
========

Improvements
------------

- ArnoldAttributes : Added `shadowGroup` attribute for performing shadow linking
  ([#2754](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2754)).
- ScaleTool : Added handles for scaling in the XY, XZ and YZ planes ([#2760](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2760), [#2664](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2664)).
- RotateTool : Added support for free rotation by dragging on a virtual
  sphere ([#2760](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2760), [#2664](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2664)).
- TranslateTool : Made XY, YX and YZ handles more visible ([#2760](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2760), [#2664](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2664)).
- Translate/Rotate/Scale tools :
  - Added support for animation ([#2721](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2721)).
  - Added control over the size of the handle via the `+` and `-` keys ([#2671](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2671), [#2769](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2769)).
- Catalogue ([#2702](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2702)) :
  - Multiple images may now be selected.
  - The selected images can now be deleted via the `Delete` and `Backspace`
    keys.
  - Images can now be reordered using drag and drop.
- OSLObject/OSLImage : Added support for more vector type conversions. Among other
  things, this allows Color4fData primitive variables to be read as `color` values
  in OSLObject, by discarding the alpha channel ([#2759](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2759)).
- GraphEditor : Added icons for Box and Reference nodes ([#2762](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2762)).

  includes the names of the plugs involved ([#2745](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2745)).
- AnimationEditor :
  - Keyframes are now pre-highlighted during drag-select ([#2768](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2768)).
  - The current frame can be set by clicking/dragging on the time axis ([#2724](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2724)).
  - When dragging keyframes in a single axis only, the viewport auto-scroll
    is now constrained to that axis ([#2724](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2724)).
- SceneReader/SceneWriter (Cortex 10.0.0-a29) :
  - Added support for scalar attributes in Alembic files.
  - Added support for quaternion primitive variables in Alembic files.
- MeshTangents : Added support for non-triangular faces (Cortex 10.0.0-a30).
- VDB : Added support for float and double metadata (Cortex 10.0.0-a31).

Fixes
-----

  application hanging during operations such as choosing AOVs in the

  application hanging during operations such as cut & paste ([#2780](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2780)).

    respect the read-only status of nodes ([#2757](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2757)).
  - Omitted connection visibility context menu items from the menu
    for auxiliary nodes, since such nodes do not have hideable connections
    ([#2752](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2752), [#2757](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2757)).

  - Fixed bugs with framerates other than 24fps.
  - Fixed selection management bug.
  - Improved numerical precision of keyframe dragging.
- Backdrop : Made resizing undoable ([#2734](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2734)).
- FileMenu : Closing a backup confirmation dialogue now aborts loading
  completely ([#2749](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2749)).
- Isolate : Fixed filter matching bug in set computation ([#2748](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2748)).
- Translate/Rotate/Scale tools : Fixed context management bug ([#2760](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2760)).
- CollectScenes : Replaced bogus ArrayPlug input with ScenePlug ([#2726](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2726)).
- Catalogue :
  - Fixed bug that caused CatalogueSelect nodes to be parented
    at the wrong level, if a nested Catalogue was promoted to the next level
    ([#2702](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2702)).
  - Fixed bug whereby image order changed if image deletion was undone ([#2767](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2767)).
- Offset : Fixed hangs caused by empty data windows ([#2770](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2770)).

- SceneReader : Fixed crashes caused by thread-safety bug in AlembicScene
  (Cortex 10.0.0-a32).
