StandardOptions
===============

Specifies the standard options (global settings) for the
scene. These should be respected by all renderers.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

options
-------

The options to be applied - arbitrary numbers of user defined options may be added
as children of this plug via the user interface, or using the CompoundDataPlug API via
python.

options.renderCamera
--------------------

The primary camera to be used for rendering. If this
is not specified, then a default orthographic camera
positioned at the origin is used.

options.filmFit
---------------

Determines how the size of the rendered image relates to the camera aperture. If the aspect
ratios of the aperture and the output resolution are the same, then this has no effect,
otherwise it dictates what method is used to preserve the pixel aspect ratio of the rendered
image.

Horizontal
:   The frustum is adjusted so that the rendered image fills the full
        width of the aperture and aspect ratio is preserved.

Vertical
:   The frustum is adjusted so that the rendered image fills the full
        height of the aperture and aspect ratio is preserved.

Fit
:   Automatically picks Horizontal or Vertical such that all of the aperture is contained
        within the output image. This may result in seeing outside the aperture at the top and
        bottom or left and right.

Fill
:   Automatically picks Horizontal or Vertical such that the output image is fully covered by
        the aperture. Part of the aperture may be cropped off at the top and bottom or left and
        right.

Distort
:   Distorts the frustum so that the aperture is fitted exactly to the output display window,
        resulting in non-square pixels

options.renderResolution
------------------------

The resolution of the image to be rendered. Use the
resolution multiplier as a convenient way to temporarily
render at multiples of this resolution.

options.pixelAspectRatio
------------------------

The aspect ratio (x/y) of the pixels in the rendered image.

options.resolutionMultiplier
----------------------------

Multiplier applied to the render resolution.

options.renderCropWindow
------------------------

Limits the render to a region of the image. The rendered
image will have the same resolution as usual, but areas
outside the crop will be rendered black. Coordinates
range from 0,0 at the top left of the image to 1,1 at the
bottom right. The crop window tool in the viewer may be
used to set this interactively.

options.overscan
----------------

Adds extra pixels to the sides of the rendered image.
This can be useful when camera shake or blur will be
added as a post process. This plug just enables overscan
as a whole - use the overscanTop, overscanBottom, overscanLeft
and overscanRight plugs to specify the amount of overscan
on each side of the image.

options.overscanTop
-------------------

The amount of overscan at the top of the image. Specified
as a 0-1 proportion of the original image height.

options.overscanBottom
----------------------

The amount of overscan at the bottom of the image. Specified
as a 0-1 proportion of the original image height.

options.overscanLeft
--------------------

The amount of overscan at the left of the image. Specified
as a 0-1 proportion of the original image width.

options.overscanRight
---------------------

The amount of overscan at the right of the image. Specified
as a 0-1 proportion of the original image width.

options.depthOfField
--------------------

Enable rendering with depth of field blur.  To get blur, you
must enable this setting, and set an f-stop on the camera you
are rendering.

options.cameraBlur
------------------

Whether or not camera motion is taken into
account in the renderered image. To specify the
number of segments to use for camera motion, use
a StandardAttributes node filtered for the camera.

options.transformBlur
---------------------

Whether or not transform motion is taken into
account in the renderered image. To specify the
number of transform segments to use for each
object in the scene, use a StandardAttributes node
with appropriate filters.

options.deformationBlur
-----------------------

Whether or not deformation motion is taken into
account in the renderered image. To specify the
number of deformation segments to use for each
object in the scene, use a StandardAttributes node
with appropriate filters.

options.shutter
---------------

The interval over which the camera shutter is open.
Measured in frames, and specified relative to the
frame being rendered.

options.sampleMotion
--------------------

Whether to actually render motion blur.  Disabling this
setting while motion blur is set up produces a render where
there is no blur, but there is accurate motion information.
Useful for rendering motion vector passes.

options.performanceMonitor
--------------------------

Enables a performance monitor and uses it to output
statistics about scene generation performance.
