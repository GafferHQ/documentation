ImageReader
===========

Reads image files from disk using OpenImageIO. All file
types supported by OpenImageIO are supported by the ImageReader
and all channel data will be converted to linear using OpenColorIO.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

fileName
--------

The name of the file to be read. File sequences with
arbitrary padding may be specified using the '#' character
as a placeholder for the frame numbers. If this file sequence
format is used, then missingFrameMode will be activated.

**Supported file extensions** : bmp, cin, dds, dpx, fits, hdr, rgbe, ico, iff, z, jpg, jpe, jpeg, jif, jfif, jfi, exr, sxr, mxr, png, ppm, pgm, pbm, pnm, pfm, psd, pdd, psb, rla, sgi, rgb, rgba, bw, int, inta, socket, pic, tiff, tif, tx, env, sm, vsm, tga, tpic, zfile

refreshCount
------------

May be incremented to force a reload if the file has
changed on disk - otherwise old contents may still
be loaded via Gaffer's cache.

missingFrameMode
----------------

Determines how missing frames are handled when the input
fileName is a file sequence (uses the '#' character).
The default behaviour is to throw an exception, but it
can also hold the last valid frame in the sequence, or
return a black image which matches the data window and
display window of the previous valid frame in the sequence.

start
-----

Masks frames which preceed the specified start frame.
The default is to treat them based on the MissingFrameMode,
but they can also be clamped to the start frame, or
return a black image which matches the data window
and display window of the start frame.

start.mode
----------

The mode used detemine the mask behaviour for the start frame.

start.frame
-----------

The start frame of the masked range.

end
---

Masks frames which follow the specified end frame.
The default is to treat them based on the MissingFrameMode,
but they can also be clamped to the end frame, or
return a black image which matches the data window
and display window of the end frame.

end.mode
--------

The mode used detemine the mask behaviour for the end frame.

end.frame
---------

The end frame of the masked range.

colorSpace
----------

The colour space of the input image, used to convert the input image to
the scene linear colorspace defined by the OpenColorIO config. The default
behaviour is to automatically determine the colorspace by calling the function
registered with `ImageReader::setDefaultColorSpaceFunction()`.
