Cryptomatte
===========

Outputs a matte channel generated from IDs selected from Cryptomatte AOVs.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The resulting image.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image containing Cryptomatte image layers and optional metadata.

layer
-----

The name of the Cryptomatte layer to use.

manifestSource
--------------

The source of the Cryptomatte manifest.

 - None: No manifest will be loaded.
 - Metadata: From the first of the following image metadata entries that
 exist for the selected Cryptomatte layer :
   - `manifest` : The manifest data.
   - `manif_file` : The name of a JSON manifest file stored in a
   directory specified on the `manifestDirectory` plug.
 - Sidecar File: From a JSON file specified on the `sidecarFile` plug.

manifestDirectory
-----------------

A directory of JSON files containing Cryptomatte manifests.

If a `manif_file` metadata entry exists for the selected Cryptomatte
layer, it will be appended to this directory. The manifest is read from
the file at the resulting path.

sidecarFile
-----------

A JSON file containing a Cryptomatte manifest.

File sequences with arbitrary padding may be specified using the '#' character
as a placeholder for the frame numbers.

**Supported file extensions** : json

outputChannel
-------------

The name of the output channel containing the extracted matte.

matteNames
----------

The list of names to be extracted as a matte.

Names are matched against entries in the Cryptomatte manifest and
Gaffer's standard wildcard characters can be used to match multiple
names.

 - /robot/*Arm matches /robot/leftArm, /robot/rightArm and
   /robot/Arm. But does not match /robot/limbs/leftArm or
   /robot/arm.

 - /.../house matches /house, /street/house and /city/street/house.

 - /robot[ABC] matches /robotA, /robotB and /robotC. But does not
   match /robotD or /robota.

Cryptomatte manifest entries containing '/' characters will be
treated as hierarchical paths and a matte will be extracted for any
entry that is matched or has an ancestor that is matched.

 - /robot extracts mattes for /robot, /robot/leftArm and
   /robot/rightArm. But does not extract /robotA or /robotLeftArm.

ID values can be specified directly by wrapping a float ID value in
angle brackets.

 - `<value>`.
