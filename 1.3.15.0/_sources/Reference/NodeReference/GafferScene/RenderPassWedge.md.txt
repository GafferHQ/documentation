RenderPassWedge
===============

Causes upstream nodes to be dispatched multiple times in a range
of contexts, each time with a different value for the `renderPass`
context variable. Each value of `renderPass` is the name of a
render pass created from one or more RenderPasses nodes in the
network upstream of the `in` plug.

Tasks can be varied per pass by using `${renderPass}` in an upstream
Spreadsheet or NameSwitch's `selector` or through use of a
ContextQuery node or an expression.

Specific passes can be disabled from wedging by setting the
`renderPass:enabled` option to `False` in contexts where that render
pass name is the value of the `renderPass` context variable.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

preTasks
--------

Input connections to upstream nodes which must be
executed before this node.

postTasks
---------

Input connections to nodes which must be
executed after this node, but which don't
need to be executed before downstream nodes.

task
----

Output connections to downstream nodes which must
not be executed until after this node.

dispatcher
----------

Container for custom plugs which dispatchers use to
control their behaviour.

dispatcher.batchSize
--------------------

Maximum number of frames to batch together when dispatching tasks.
If the node requires sequence execution `batchSize` will be ignored.

dispatcher.immediate
--------------------

Causes this node to be executed immediately upon dispatch,
rather than have its execution be scheduled normally by
the dispatcher. For instance, when using the LocalDispatcher,
the node will be executed immediately in the dispatching process
and not in a background process as usual.

When a node is made immediate, all upstream nodes are automatically
considered to be immediate too, regardless of their settings.

in
--

The input scene containing the render passes to wedge.

out
---

A direct pass-through of the input scene.

names
-----

The names of the render passes to be wedged.
