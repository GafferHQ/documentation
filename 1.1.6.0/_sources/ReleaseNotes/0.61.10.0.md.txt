0.61.10.0
=========

Features
--------

- Tools Menu : Added item to populate the Arnold GPU cache, which may improve startup times for GPU renders.

Improvements
------------

- Viewer : Tool hotkeys now work as toggles for non-exclusive tools. This is currently noticeable on the Camera Tool - pressing <kbd>T</kbd> again will deactivate it.
- ArnoldShader and ArnoldLight : Added activators and sections to the UI.
- ImageWriter : Options are only displayed for the file format being written. If the extension is unknown, all format options are shown.
- Light Editor : Added keyboard shortcuts for selected light.
  - <kbd>Alt+E</kbd> : Edit source node.
  - <kbd>Shift+Alt+E</kbd> : Edit tweaks node.
- Edit Menu : Added item to rename one or more selected nodes, with accompanying keyboard shortcut ([#4286](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/4286)).
- Box : Rename plug dialogue now ensures names are valid as they are typed.

Fixes
-----

- ArnoldMeshLight : Fixed illumination from textured mesh lights. This was broken in 0.61.2.0.

API
---

- ArnoldShader : Added support for `gaffer.layout.activator` and `gaffer.layout.visibilityActivator` in `.mtd` files.
- PlugLayout : User interface sections are now hidden if all plugs in that section are hidden.
