1.1.3.0
=======

Features
--------

- Image Viewer :
  - Added "Match Display Windows" option to Compare Mode menu. This allows the comparison mode to directly view a low-res render over a high-res plate, providing better performance than scaling up the render using the node graph.
  - The Color Inspector now shows color values for both images when comparing. Picking a color by dragging from the image now selects the composited on-screen color, taking into account  "Compare Mode" and the wipe.

Improvements
------------

- EditScope Menu :
  - Changed the order of listed EditScopes to be alphabetical.
  - Added an icon to menu items that are ancestors of the active EditScope.
  - Menu items that only have a single item in their sub-menu are now collapsed into the parent item.

Fixes
-----

- Shader Viewer : Fixed (was broken in 1.1.2.0).
- Image Viewer :
  - Fixed visual artifact when using a wipe with Replace compare mode on images with mismatched pixel aspect ratios.
  - Fixed context used to compute the view menu for the image being shown. On the first update, an empty context was being used instead of the script's context.
  - Color Inspector :
    - Corrected half-pixel offset in measured pixel values.
    - Pixel location indicators are no longer affected by the display color transform.
- GraphEditor : Fixed crash when focussing an empty ContextVariables, NameSwitch or Loop node ([#4944](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/4944)).
- UI :
  - Fixed tooltips containing raw HTML.
  - Fixed stalls caused by Qt repeatedly accessing the same icon files.
- DocumentationAlgo : Fixed handling of raw HTML by `markdownToHTML()`.
- Reference : Fixed unnecessary serialisation of connections from internal plugs to external plugs. These are serialised in the `.grf` file already, so do not need to be duplicated on the Reference node itself. This bug prevented changes to the internal connections from taking effect when reloading a modified `.grf` file, and could cause load failures when the connections were from an internal Expression ([#4935](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/4935)).
- MeshToLevelSet, LevelSetOffset : Fixed bug that could cause partial results to be returned if a previous operation was cancelled.
- PlugValueWidget : Fixed unnecessary updates when calling `setContext()` with the same context.

API
---

- MenuDefinition : Added `icon` attribute support to `subMenu` items.
