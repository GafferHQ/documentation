CopyAttributes
==============

Copies attributes from a second scene, adding them to the attributes
of the main input scene.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scenes

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

attributes
----------

The names of the attributes to be copied. These should be
separated by spaces and can use Gaffer's standard wildcards
to match multiple attributes.

copyFrom
--------

The location that attributes are copied from. By default, attributes
are copied from the location equivalent to the one they are being copied to.

deleteExisting
--------------

Deletes all attributes from the input scene before adding the copied
attributes.
