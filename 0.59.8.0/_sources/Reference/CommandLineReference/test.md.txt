test
====

Runs the unit tests for all of Gaffer's python
modules and libraries. These are run automatically
as part of Gaffer's build and review process, but it
is useful to run them manually when developing for
Gaffer or troubleshooting an installation.

Run all the tests :

```
gaffer test
```

Run all the tests for the scene module :

```
gaffer test GafferScene
```

Repeat a specific test 10 times :

```
gaffer test -repeat 10 GafferImageTest.ImageNodeTest.testCacheThreadSafety

```

-help
-----

Prints names and descriptions of each parameter rather than running the application.

-threads
--------

The maximum number of threads used for computation. The default value of zero causes the number of threads to  be chosen automatically based on the available hardware.

-profileFileName
----------------

If this is specified, then the application is run using the cProfile profiling module, and the results saved to the file for later examination.

-testCases
----------

A list of names of specific test cases to run. If unspecified then all test cases are run.

-repeat
-------

The number of times to repeat the tests.

-performanceOnly
----------------

Skips tests that don't compute performance metrics.

-outputFile
-----------

The name of a JSON file that the results are written to.

-previousOutputFile
-------------------

The name of a JSON file containing the results of a previous test run. This will be used to detect and report performance regressions.

-stopOnFailure
--------------

Stops on the first failure, instead of running the remaining tests.
