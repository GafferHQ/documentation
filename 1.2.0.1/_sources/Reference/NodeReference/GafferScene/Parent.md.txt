Parent
======

Parents additional child hierarchies into the main scene hierarchy.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

parent
------

The location which the children are parented under. This is
ignored when a filter is connected, in which case the children
are parented under all the locations matched by the filter.

destination
-----------

The location where the children will be placed in the output scene.
The default is to place the children under the parent, but they may
be relocated anywhere while still inheriting the parent's transform.
This is particularly useful when parenting lights to geometry but
wanting to group them and control their visibility separately.

When the destination is evaluated, the `${scene:path}` variable holds
the source location matched by the filter. This allows the children
to be placed relative to the "parent". For example, `${scene:path}/..`
will place the children alongside the "parent" rather than under it.

children
--------

The child hierarchies to be parented.

parentVariable
--------------

A context variable used to pass the location of the parent to the
upstream nodes connected into the `children` plug. This can be used
to procedurally vary the children at each different parent location.
