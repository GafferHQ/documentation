0.35.7
======

* Fixed bug which caused Windows to be hidden when being added as the child of another Window.

* Window.setVisible( True ) now ensures that the Window is unminimized and raised where necessary.

* Added NodeEditor.acquire() method, to allow other UI elements to request that a Node editor be shown in some way for a specific node.

* Double clicking a node in the graph now shows a floating Node Editor for that node.

* Added MultiLineTextWidget.dropTextSignal(), making it easy to implement drag and drop for different datatypes. This simplifies the ScriptEditor implementation somewhat.

* Added an improved ui for editing expressions. Context menu on plugs allows for creation and editing of expressions, and the expression editor accepts drag and drop of plugs.

* Random node no longer errors when context items are missing - this prevents the UI from erroring when scene:path etc is not available.

* NumericSlider now allows specification of hardMin and hardMax values to control what happens when the slider is dragged outside of the widget area.

* Slider now draws the position differently to indicate when the position is outside of the widget area.

* Fixed ColorChooser bugs caused by dragging sliders outside of sensible ranges - the ranges are now enforced.

* Added GafferUI.DisplayTransform class for managing colour transformations from linear to display space. Updated ColorSwatch and ColorChooser classes to use this, and added ocio.py config file to set up the transform using PyOpenColorIO.

* Added GafferUI.ExecuteUI module with functionality for executing nodes, repeating previous executions etc. This provides a new execute menu in the main menu, and a right click menu item in the graph editor.

* Fixed bug which meant that dynamic CompoundNumericPlugs would fail to restore their connections upon script load.

* Arnold shaders may now be connected together to form networks, and they may have non-shader inputs (such as the Random node) which can be evaluated on a per-object basis to provide additional variation.

* Fixed error caused by browser preview tab.
