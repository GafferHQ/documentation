0.61.4.0
========

Features
--------

- FormatQuery : Added new node for querying the format of an image and outputting its displayWindow, pixelAspect, center and size.

Improvements
------------

- GraphEditor : The focus gadget is now toggled when the button is released rather than when it is pressed. This helps avoid accidental toggling when performing marquee selection.
- ErrorDialogue : Improved error text for SyntaxError exceptions, and added debug log messages containing Python stack traces.

Fixes
-----

- GraphEditor : Fixed bug which could prevent the active node highlighting updating when the focus node was deleted.
- InteractiveArnoldRender : Fixed warnings when editing a parameter of a light with a connected OSL shader.
- ScriptNode : Fixed bug which meant that `focusChangedSignal()` wasn't emitted when the focus node was deleted.
- Viewer : Fixed visualisation of IES lights.
