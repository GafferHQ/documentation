0.55.0.0
========

This release brings numerous enhancements to the Layout system, new and improved 3D nodes, performance tweaks and new tools.

> Caution : The Instancer now deletes the target point cloud from the scene ([#3394](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3394)). This will
> result in a behaviour change in existing scenes that rely on the target point cloud
> existing downstream of the Instancer node.

> Info : The companion patch release `0.54.2.1` includes support to allow scripts saved from
> `0.55.0.0` to be opened in environments locked to the `0.54.x.x` series. However, scripts
> saved in `0.55.0.0` that make use of multiple input connections to the Parent node are not
> compatible with any previous versions.

Features
--------

- NameSwitch : Added new node to switch between named input connections using string matching ([#3349](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3349)).
- CopyPrimitiveVariables : Added new node to copy primitive variables from one object to another ([#3361](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3361), [#3389](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3389)).
- Viewer : Transform tools now feature a ‘targeted’ mode ([#3403](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3403)).
   - Holding <kbd>V</kbd> and clicking in the Viewer with the Translate tool active teleports the selected objects to the clicked point.
   - Holding <kbd>V</kbd> and clicking in the Viewer with the Rotate tool active aims the selection’s -z axis at the clicked point.

Improvements
------------

- Layouts ([#3360](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3360), [#3392](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3392), [#3398](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3398), [#3399](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3399)) :
  - The focus state and linking of each editor is now saved with the layout.
  - All default layouts now include linked editors as standard, with all inspectors following the Viewer, and all other editors following the Graph Editor selection.
  - Viewers can now be linked to other Viewers.
  - The Pinning button has been re-designed as the Editor Focus menu, moving all interactions to a left-click menu.
  - Editor-centric keyboard shortcuts have been added and other shortcuts improved :
    - Hitting <kbd>P</kbd> will pin the editor to the current node selection
    - Hitting <kbd>N</kbd> will make the editor follow the current node selection (a.k.a ‘un-pin’).
    - All keyboard shortcuts that change an editor’s focus, when used with a slave editor will now break any links to it’s master.
  - When hovering over an entry in the Follow section of the Editor Focus menu, the target editor will be highlighted.
  - When hovering over the editor focus menu button for a master editor, all of the following (slave) editors will be highlighted when its tooltip is presented.
  - When hovering over the editor focus menu button for a slave editor, its master editor will be highlighted when its tooltip is presented.
  - Improved editor link colors.
  - Editor/Inspector tab titles now only include node names when the editor is pinned.
  - The UVInspector can now be linked to other editors.
