0.49.1.0
========

Improvements
------------

- SceneReader : Added transform plug, allowing caches to be positioned without needing a
  separate Transform node ([#2792](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2792)).

Fixes
-----

- SubGraph : Fixed crash bug in `correspondingInput()`. This typically manifested itself
  as a crash when trying to delete or cut a box ([#2796](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2796)).
- FileMenu : Added confirmation dialogue for "Revert to Saved", and added proper error
  reporting for loading errors ([#2735](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2735), [#2794](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2794)).
- SetUI/FilteredSceneProcessorUI : Fixed bugs dealing with ArrayPlug inputs. These were
  most visible as errors when working with the CopyAttributes node ([#2785](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2785)).
- File Browser : Fixed crash when pointed at files with strange permissions. ([#2800](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2800)).
- GraphEditor : Fixed hangs when framing backdrops ([#2801](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2801)).

Documentation
-------------

- Added "Anatomy of a Scene" article ([#2787](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2787)).

API
---

- ParallelAlgo : Refactored `callOnUIThread()` internals ([#2786](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2786)).
