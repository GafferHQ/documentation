0.61.11.0
=========

Features
--------

- AttributeTweaks : Added node to tweak scene location attributes.

Improvements
------------

- ShaderQuery and ShaderTweaks : Improved labels of menu items that open shader browsers by adding "..." to the item name.

Fixes
-----

- SetFilter : Fixed missing set names in `setExpression` context menu. Sets were being listed for nodes directly connected to the filter, but not for nodes downstream of an intermediate filter such as a UnionFilter ([#2678](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2678)).
- Fixed `NameValue` plugs having a `delete` menu item in their popup menu when they shouldn't. This was broken in 0.61.9.0.
- PythonEditor : Fixed autocompletion errors triggered by dictionaries with non-string keys.
- ColorChooserPlugValueWidget/ColorSwatchPlugValueWidget : Fixed handling of errors when computing the plug value.
- PlugAlgo : Fixed crash in `setValueFromData()` when setting the value of a BoxPlug (other than a Box2iPlug).

API
---

- TweakPlug : Added functor-based variation of `applyTweak` allowing greater control of how users get and set the data being tweaked. `TweaksPlug::applyTweaks` now uses that method and can be used as a reference implementation.
- ColorChooser/ColorSwatch : Added `setErrored()` and `getErrored()` methods.
