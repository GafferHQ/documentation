OptionQuery
===========

Queries global scene options, creating an output for each option.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

scene
-----

The scene to query the options from.

queries
-------

The options to be queried - arbitrary numbers of options may be added
as children of this plug via the user interface, or via python. Each
child is a `NameValuePlug` whose `name` plug is the option to query,
and whose `value` plug is the default value to use if the option can
not be retrieved.

out
---

The parent plug of the query outputs. The order of outputs corresponds
to the order of children of `queries`.
