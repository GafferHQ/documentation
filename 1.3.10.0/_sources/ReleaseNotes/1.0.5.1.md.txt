Fixes
-----

- GafferImage : Fixed `Context has no variable named "image:viewName"` errors. If `image:viewName` is not provided by a context, GafferImage automatically falls back to a value of `default`.

API
---

- GUI config : Stopped adding an `image:viewName` variable to `Script.variables`. This was an attempt to provide fallbacks for legacy code that didn't provide the `image:viewName` context variable, but it was only partially effective. It is unnecessary now that GafferImage has internal fallbacks instead.
