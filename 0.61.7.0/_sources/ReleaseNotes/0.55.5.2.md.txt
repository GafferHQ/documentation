0.55.5.2
========

- Expression : Fixed retrieval of boolean context variables via the OSL `context()` function.
- Backdrop : Fixed bug that prevented context variables from being used by the `title` and `description` plugs. All variables from the global script context are now available.
- Box : Fixed bug that allowed locked plugs to be promoted.
- TransformTools : Fixed rare crash triggered by selecting multiple objects.
- Floating Editors : Fixed keyboard shortcuts ([#3632](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3632)).
- ArnoldTextureBake :  Fixed imbalanced distribution of work among tasks when some UDIMs contain many more objects than others.
- StandardOptions : Fixed bug which meant that the camera chooser dialogue started browsing in the user's home directory, not the root of the scene ([#3695](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3695)).
- Spreadsheet :
  - Fixed scrollbar flickering in Spreadsheets with two rows ([#3628](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3628)).
  - Fixed bug which changed the width of the row name column when new rows were added.
