CollectPrimitiveVariables
=========================

Make copies of target primitive variables with different suffixes,
where the new suffixed copies come from different contexts.

By combining this with a SceneTimeWarp, you can create copies of
primitive variables at different times, useful for creating trail
effects.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

primitiveVariables
------------------

A match pattern for which primitive variables will be copied.

suffixes
--------

The names of the new suffixes to add to copies of the target
primitive variables.  The new suffixed variables will be
copied from different contexts.

suffixContextVariable
---------------------

The name of a context variable that is set to the current
suffix when evaluating the input object. This can be used
in upstream expressions and string substitutions to vary
the object while creating the primvar copies.

For example, you could drive a SceneTimeWarp with this
variable in order create copies of a primitive variable at
different times.

requireVariation
----------------

If true, newly copied primitive variables will only be created
if the source object is differs in some of the suffix contexts.
If the source object never changes, it will be passed through
unchanged ( since there is no variation, you can just use the
original primitive variables ).
