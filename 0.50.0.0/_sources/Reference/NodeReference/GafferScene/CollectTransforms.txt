CollectTransforms
=================

Collects transforms in different contexts, storing the results as attributes. The
names of the attributes being collected are provided as a context variable,
which can be used to vary the transforms that are collected.

By combining this with a SceneTimeWarp, you can create copies of
the transform at different times, useful for creating trail
effects.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

attributes
----------

The names of the new attributes to create.  The new attributes will be
copied from the transform in different contexts.

attributeContextVariable
------------------------

The name of a context variable that is set to the current
attribute name when evaluating the transform. This can be used
in upstream expressions and string substitutions to vary
the transform.

For example, you could drive a SceneTimeWarp with this
variable in order create copies of the transform at
different times.

space
-----

If you select world space, the created attributes will contain a concatenation
of all transforms from the root of the scene to the current location.

requireVariation
----------------

If true, new attributes will only be created
if the transform differs in some of the contexts.
If the transform never changes, no new attributes will be created
( you can just use the transform instead of accessing the new attributes ).

transforms
----------

This hidden plug is a CompoundObject that contains just the new
transform attributes.

It is primarily used for internal computation, but there are
cases where you can improve performance by naughtily plugging
it into an expression.
