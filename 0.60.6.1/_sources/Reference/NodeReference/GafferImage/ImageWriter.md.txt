ImageWriter
===========

Writes image files to disk using OpenImageIO. All file
types supported by OpenImageIO are supported by the
ImageWriter.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

preTasks
--------

Input connections to upstream nodes which must be
executed before this node.

postTasks
---------

Input connections to nodes which must be
executed after this node, but which don't
need to be executed before downstream nodes.

task
----

Output connections to downstream nodes which must
not be executed until after this node.

dispatcher
----------

Container for custom plugs which dispatchers use to
control their behaviour.

dispatcher.batchSize
--------------------

Maximum number of frames to batch together when dispatching tasks.
If the node requires sequence execution `batchSize` will be ignored.

dispatcher.immediate
--------------------

Causes this node to be executed immediately upon dispatch,
rather than have its execution be scheduled normally by
the dispatcher. For instance, when using the LocalDispatcher,
the node will be executed immediately in the dispatching process
and not in a background process as usual.

When a node is made immediate, all upstream nodes are automatically
considered to be immediate too, regardless of their settings.

in
--

The image to be written to disk.

fileName
--------

The name of the file to be written. File sequences with
arbitrary padding may be specified using the '#' character
as a placeholder for the frame numbers.

**Supported file extensions** : bmp, dib, cin, dds, dpx, fits, hdr, rgbe, ico, iff, z, jpg, jpe, jpeg, jif, jfif, jfi, null, nul, exr, sxr, mxr, png, ppm, pgm, pbm, pnm, pfm, psd, pdd, psb, bay, bmq, cr2, crw, cs1, dc2, dcr, dng, erf, fff, k25, kdc, mdc, mos, mrw, nef, orf, pef, pxn, raf, raw, rdc, sr2, srf, x3f, arw, 3fr, cine, ia, kc2, mef, nrw, qtk, rw2, sti, rwl, srw, drf, dsc, ptx, cap, iiq, rwz, cr3, rla, sgi, rgb, rgba, bw, int, inta, socket, pic, tif, tiff, tx, env, sm, vsm, tga, tpic, term, zfile, osl, oso, oslgroup, oslbody

channels
--------

The names of the channels to be written to the file.
Names should be separated by spaces and may contain any
of Gaffer's standard wildcards.

colorSpace
----------

The colour space of the output image, used to convert the input image
from the scene linear colorspace defined by the OpenColorIO config.
The default behaviour is to automatically determine the colorspace by
calling the function registered with `ImageWriter::setDefaultColorSpaceFunction()`.

out
---

A pass-through of the input image.

openexr
-------

Format options specific to OpenEXR files.

openexr.mode
------------

The write mode for the OpenEXR file - scanline or tiled data.

openexr.compression
-------------------

The compression method to use when writing the OpenEXR file.

openexr.dwaCompressionLevel
---------------------------

The compression level used when writing files with DWAA or DWAB compression.
Higher values decrease file size at the expense of image quality.

openexr.dataType
----------------

The data type to be written to the OpenEXR file.

openexr.depthDataType
---------------------

Overriding the data type for depth channels is useful because many of the things depth is used
for require greater precision.

dpx
---

Format options specific to DPX files.

dpx.dataType
------------

The data type to be written to the DPX file.

tiff
----

Format options specific to TIFF files.

tiff.mode
---------

The write mode for the TIFF file - scanline or tiled data.

tiff.compression
----------------

The compression method to use when writing the TIFF file.

tiff.dataType
-------------

The data type to be written to the TIFF file.

field3d
-------

Format options specific to Field3D files.

field3d.mode
------------

The write mode for the Field3D file - scanline or tiled data.

field3d.dataType
----------------

The data type to be written to the Field3D file.

fits
----

Format options specific to FITS files.

fits.dataType
-------------

The data type to be written to the FITS file.

iff
---

Format options specific to IFF files.

iff.mode
--------

The write mode for the IFF file - scanline or tiled data.

jpeg
----

Format options specific to Jpeg files.

jpeg.compressionQuality
-----------------------

The compression quality for the Jpeg file to be written.
A value between 0 (low quality, high compression) and
100 (high quality, low compression).

jpeg.chromaSubSampling
----------------------

The chroma sub sampling used to write the jpeg file.
Note that the file will be stored as YCbCr instead of RGB.

jpeg2000
--------

Format options specific to Jpeg2000 files.

jpeg2000.dataType
-----------------

The data type to be written to the Jpeg2000 file.

png
---

Format options specific to PNG files.

png.compression
---------------

The compression method to use when writing the PNG file.

png.compressionLevel
--------------------

The compression level of the PNG file. This is a value between
0 (no compression) and 9 (most compression).

rla
---

Format options specific to RLA files.

rla.dataType
------------

The data type to be written to the RLA file.

sgi
---

Format options specific to SGI files.

sgi.dataType
------------

The data type to be written to the SGI file.

targa
-----

Format options specific to Targa files.

targa.compression
-----------------

The compression method to use when writing the Targa file.

webp
----

Format options specific to WebP files.

webp.compressionQuality
-----------------------

The compression quality for the WebP file to be written.
A value between 0 (low quality, high compression) and
100 (high quality, low compression).
