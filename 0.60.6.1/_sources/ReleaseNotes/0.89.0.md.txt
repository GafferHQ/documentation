0.89.0
======

#### Core

- Added Support for NumericPlug->BoolPlug and BoolPlug->NumericPlug connections.

#### UI

- Added additional types to the user plug creation menu.
- Added pre-selection highlighting in the NodeGraph ([#94](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/94)).
- Added "Create Expression..." menu option for bool plugs.
- Fixed NodeGraph resizing to crop rather than scale ([#10](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/10)).
- Fixed read only CompoundPlug labels.
- Added workarounds for Qt OpenGL problem on OS X ([#404](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/404) and [#396](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/396)).

#### Scene

- Added Parent node. This allows one hierarchy to be parented into another ([#91](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/91)).
- Fixed bug which could cause incorrect bound computation at the parent node in the Instancer.
- Seeds and Instancer classes now preserve existing children of the parent location, renaming the new locations to avoid name clashes if necessary.
- Added tag filtering to the SceneReader node.

- Added scene cache previews to the browser and view apps ([#416](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/416)).
