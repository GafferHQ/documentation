Spreadsheet
===========

Provides a spreadsheet designed for easy management of sets of
associated plug values. Each column of the spreadsheet corresponds
to an output value that can be connected to drive a plug on another
node. Each row of the spreadsheet provides candidate values for each
output, along with a row name and enabled status. Row names are matched
against a selector to determine which row is passed through to the output.
Row matching is performed as follows :

- Matching starts with the second row and considers all subsequent
  rows one by one until a match is found. The first matching row
  is the one that is chosen.
- Matching is performed using Gaffer's standard wildcard matching.
  Each "name" may contain several individual patterns each separated
  by spaces.
- The first row is used as a default, and is chosen only if no other
  row matches.

> Note : The matching rules are identical to the ones used by the
> NameSwitch node.

----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

enabled

Turns the node on and off.

selector

The value that the row names will be matched against.
Typically this will refer to a Context Variable using
the `${variableName}` syntax.

rows

out
---

The outputs from the spreadsheet. Contains a child plug for each
column in the spreadsheet.

activeRowNames
