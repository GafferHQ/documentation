0.53.0.0
========

This release provides several features useful for look development, including component-level
connections for colour and vector parameters, a new ShaderTweaks node for making downstream tweaks,
and an ArnoldTextureBake node for baking UV textures. We've also added a nifty new system for quickly
accessing nodes via numeric hotkeys, and made numerous other enhancements and bug fixes.

> Caution : This release replaces nodes such as SceneLoop and ImageLoop with more general purpose
> nodes such as Loop. Backwards compatibility is provided for loading old scripts, but any scripts
> saved in Gaffer 0.53 will _not be loadable in previous versions_. Test carefully before upgrading,
> because there is no going back.

Features
--------

- ArnoldTextureBake : Added a new node for baking Arnold shading networks down into
  UV textures ([#2931](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2931)).
- Numeric bookmarks : Added the ability to associate a numeric hotkey to a node, providing
  quick pinning of the node into any editor. Use `Ctrl+[0-9]` in the GraphEditor to assign
  the bookmark, and then simply hit `[0-9]` to pin that node into the editor below the
  cursor ([#2974](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2974)).
- ShaderTweaks : Added a new node to allow shader parameters to be overridden
  downstream of the shader assignment. This replaces the old LightTweaks node, with
  the addition of new functionality to allow new connections to be made ([#2954](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2954), [#2983](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2983)).
- GraphEditor : Added support for making connections to the individual components of colour
  and vector parameters ([#2938](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2938), [#2973](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2973), [#755](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/755)).
- Viewer ([#2985](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2985), [#2666](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2666), [#2717](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2717), [#3001](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3001)) :
  - Added "History" context menu for the selected scene object.
    - Added "Edit Source..." to open a NodeEditor for the node that created the object.
    - Added "Edit Tweaks..." to open a NodeEditor for the most recent ShaderTweaks node
      applied to the object.
- BoxOut : Added a `passThrough` plug, providing a convenient way of allowing
  Boxes to be disabled ([#2879](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2879)).
- UDIMQuery : Added a new node to query the texture UDIMs used by a set of
  objects ([#2913](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2913)).
- Wireframe : Added a new node for converting MeshPrimitives into a wireframe
  representation using CurvesPrimitives ([#2914](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2914)).

Improvements
------------

- Loop : Added plug context menu item for connecting previous to next ([#2887](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2887)).
- ArnoldOptions :
  - Added adaptive sampling settings ([#2919](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2919)).
  - Added low light threshold ([#2968](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2968)).
  - Added support for JSON stats files ([#2984](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2984)).
- ArnoldRender ([#2919](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2919)) :
  - Added support for a "camera" parameter in outputs, allowing renders from
    multiple cameras to be performed in a single process.
  - Added support for Arnold's `uv_camera`.
- SceneInspector : Added curve basis to Object section ([#2892](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2892)).
- Dispatch app : Added `-show` argument to control which nodes are shown
  in `-gui` mode ([#2900](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2900)).
- Dispatcher ([#2942](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2942)) :
  - Added `dispatcher:scriptFileName` context variable.
  - Added support for nested dispatchers, with the inner dispatch sharing the
    job directory for the outer dispatch ([#2942](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2942)).
- Dot/ContextProcessor/Switch/Loop : Improved serialisation to use a call to `setup()`
  rather than manual creation of plugs. This makes the serialisation format a better
  learning tool for aspiring scripters ([#2981](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2981)).
- BoolPlugValueWidget : Added colour to indicate animation inputs and compute errors
 ([#2990](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2990)).
- OSLShader : Improved nodule labelling ([#2983](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2983)).
- PlugAdder : Added support for label metadata ([#2345](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2345), [#2983](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2983)).
- Shader/Light : Improved the representation of shaders in the scene dataflow. These
  now use a dedicated `IECoreScene::ShaderNetwork` class rather than a cumbersome
  `IECore::ObjectVector`. This lays the groundwork for features such as downstream
  tweaks ([#2902](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2902)).
- GraphEditor : Changed hotkey for the Bookmarks menu from `Ctrl+B` to `B` ([#3000](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3000)).
- Error Handling : Added the plug full name, frame, and scene path (if applicable)
  to the logging output as additional `DEBUG` log messages ([#2976](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2976)).

Fixes
-----

- ValuePlug : Fixed bug in finding the ComputeNode for a plug. In specific
  circumstances this could cause a `Value for Plug not set as expected`
  error ([#2955](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2955), [#2950](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2950)).
- ViewportGadget/GadgetWidget : Fixed enter/leave event handling bug ([#2938](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2938)).
- Context : Fixed fallback value for `get()` method ([#2987](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2987)).
- GraphLayout : Fixed GIL management bugs that could cause deadlock ([#2988](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2988)).
- ShaderAssignment : OSL shaders of type "shader" are now assigned correctly
  as "osl:surface" and not "osl:shader" ([#2983](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2983)).
- Metadata bindings : Fix crashes caused by calling `value( None )` ([#2996](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2996)).

  Editing in Python".

Breaking Changes
----------------

- LightTweaks : Replaced with new general-purpose `ShaderTweaks` node ([#2954](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2954)).
- Shader : Shaders are now represented with `IECoreScene::ShaderNetworks` rather than
  `IECore::ObjectVectors` ([#2902](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2902)).
- Dispatcher : The base class now saves the script to dispatch automatically, so derived
  classes no longer need to do so ([#2942](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2942)).
- Metadata ([#2953](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2953)) :
  - Removed all deprecated methods.
  - `NodeValueFunction` has been replaced by a generic `GraphComponentFunction`. This allows
     metadata to be registered by Plug TypeId.
- TweakPlug :
  - Changed signatures for `applyTweak()` and constructor ([#2954](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2954)).
  - Changed base class ([#2983](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2983)).
- ContextProcessors : Removed SceneContextVariables, DeleteSceneContextVariables,
  SceneTimeWarp, ImageContextVariables, DeleteImageContextVariables and ImageTimeWarp nodes.
  Use the generic equivalents instead. Compatibility with old scripts is provided by
  converting them automatically on loading ([#2880](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2880)).
- Loops : Removed SceneLoop and ImageLoop nodes. Use the generic Loop node instead.
  Compatibility with old scripts is provided by converting them automatically on
  loading ([#2887](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2887)).
- ScriptEditor ([#2876](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2876)) :
  - Renamed to `PythonEditor`. Compatibility with old scripts and layouts is preserved
    by a config file.
  - Removed `script` variable. Use the new `root` variable instead.
  - Removed `parent` variable. Paste serialised scripts using the GraphEditor
    instead.
- Screengrab app : Renamed `-scriptEditor` argument to `pythonEditor` ([#2876](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2876)).
- Dispatch app : Renamed `-nodes` argument to `-tasks` ([#2900](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2900)).
- Nodule : Added virtual method ([#2938](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2938)).
- ScriptNode : Removed `scriptExecutedSignal()` ([#2996](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2996)).
