ObjectToImage
=============

Converts Cortex ImagePrimitives into Gaffer's standard
form, so they can processed using Gaffer's image
processing nodes. This is a somewhat esoteric node, and
is unlikely to have a great number of uses.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

object
------

The Cortex ImagePrimitive to be converted. The most
likely source of one of these would be an ObjectReader
from the GafferCortex module.
