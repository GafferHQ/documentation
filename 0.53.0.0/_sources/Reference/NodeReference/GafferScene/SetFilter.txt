SetFilter
=========

A filter which uses sets to define which locations are matched.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the filter. When it is off, the
filter does not match any locations.

out
---

The result of the filter. This should be connected into
the "filter" plug of a FilteredSceneProcessor.

setExpression
-------------

A set expression that computes a set that defines
the locations to be matched.

For example, the expression "mySpheresSet | myCubesSet"
will create a set that contains all objects in
mySpheresSet and myCubesSet.

Gaffer supports the union operator (|) as shown in the
example and also provides intersection (&) and difference (-)
operations for set expressions. Names of locations
can be used to represent a set that contains only
that one location.

For more examples please consult the Scripting Reference
section in Gaffer's documentation.

The context menu of the set expression text field provides
entries that help construct set expressions.
