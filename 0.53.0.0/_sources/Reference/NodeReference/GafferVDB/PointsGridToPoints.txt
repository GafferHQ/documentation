PointsGridToPoints
==================

Converts a points grid in a VDB object to a points primitive.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

grid
----

Name of the points grid in the VDB to create a points primitive from.

names
-----

The names of the primitive variables to be extracted from VDB points grid.
Names should be separated by spaces, and Gaffer's
standard wildcard characters may be used.

invertNames
-----------

When on, the primitive variables matched by names
are not extracted, and the non-matching primitive
variables are extracted instead.
