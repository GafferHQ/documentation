ObjectReader
============

Loads objects from disk using the readers provided by
the Cortex project. In most cases it is preferable to
use a dedicated SceneReader or ImageReader instead of
this node.

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.
