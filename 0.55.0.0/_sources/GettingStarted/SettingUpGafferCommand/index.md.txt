# Setting Up the "gaffer" Command #

After you have installed Gaffer, it will remain a collection of files and directories on your file system. Because it is not yet configured as a command, you must navigate to its directory every time. This could become very tedious, so we recommend that you modify your `PATH` environment variable to allow access to the `gaffer` command from anywhere in the terminal.

> Note :
> For these instructions, we will assume you have Gaffer installed to the `/opt/` directory. If you have installed it elsewhere, replace `/opt/` with the directory you installed it to.


### Environment variables ###

An environment variable is simply a value, such as a string, number, boolean, or location that your terminal is aware of. For instance, when you ran the `tar` command to extract the downloaded Gaffer package, the `tar` command was not located in your `~/Downloads` directory, but actually in `/usr/bin/`. Whenever you open your terminal, several folders are added to your terminal's `PATH` environment variable, which provides it with a list of locations in the file system from which it can source commands.

In order for the `gaffer` command to work in your terminal, you will need to add Gaffer's directory to the `PATH` environment variable.


## Setting up the "gaffer" command in Linux ##

The particular terminal on your system depends on your Linux distribution and how it was configured. Most distributions of Linux use _bash_, but there are other common terminals available, like _tcsh_. Because we cannot accommodate every available terminal, we will only provide instructions for adding to the `PATH` variable in _bash_ and _tcsh_.

> Tip : 
> If you are not sure which terminal you have, you can find its name by opening a terminal and inputting `echo $0`, which will return `/bin/bash`, `tcsh`, or some equivalent. If you are not using _bash_ or _tcsh_, the same principles of environment variables will apply, and your terminal's documentation should provide a comparable way of modifying the `PATH` variable.

To set up the `gaffer` command in Linux:

1. Open your terminal's config file in a text editor.
    
    - _bash_ config: `~/.bash_profile`
    - _tcsh_ config: `~/.tcsh_profile`

2. Add the following line to the end of the file:
    
    - _bash:_ `export PATH=$PATH\:/opt/gaffer-!GAFFER_VERSION!-linux/bin`
    - _tcsh:_ `setenv PATH $PATH\:/opt/gaffer-!GAFFER_VERSION!-linux/bin`

3. Save the file.

4. Open a terminal.

5. Test that the `PATH` variable has been updated:

    ```bash
    user@desktop ~ $ echo $PATH
    # /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/opt/gaffer-!GAFFER_VERSION!-linux/bin
    ```

> Note :
> Depending on your system configuration, the beginning of your `PATH` variable might not appear exactly as above. What's important is whether `/opt/gaffer-!GAFFER_VERSION!-linux/bin` appears at the end of the path.

You can now execute `gaffer` as a command from any directory in the terminal.


## Setting up the "gaffer" command in OSX ##

The default terminal in OSX is _bash_, so you will need to add to the `PATH` variable in the _bash_ user config.

To set up the `gaffer` command in OSX:

1. Open `~/.bash_profile` in a text editor.

2. Add the line `export PATH=$PATH\:/opt/gaffer-!GAFFER_VERSION!-osx/bin` and save.

3. Open the terminal (Finder > Go > Utilities > Terminal).

4. Test that the `PATH` variable has been updated:

    ```bash
    MacBook:~ user$ echo $PATH
    # /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/opt/gaffer-!GAFFER_VERSION!-osx/bin
    ```

> Note :
> Depending on your system configuration, the beginning of your `PATH` variable might not appear exactly as above. What's important is whether `/opt/gaffer-!GAFFER_VERSION!-osx/bin` appears at the end of the path.

You can now execute `gaffer` as a command from any directory in the terminal.


## Using the "gaffer" command ##

Once you have added the Gaffer directory to the `PATH` variable, you can launch Gaffer anywhere in the terminal:

```bash
gaffer
```

You can also use the command to open Gaffer scripts, as outlined in the [Command Line Reference](../../Reference/CommandLineReference/index.md).
