NameSwitch
==========

Switches between multiple input connections, passing through the
chosen input to the output. Each input has a "name" as well
as a value, and switching is performed by comparing the names against
the value of `selector` as follows :

- Matching starts with the second input and considers all subsequent
  inputs one by one until a match is found. The first matching input
  is the one that is chosen.
- Matching is performed using Gaffer's standard wildcard matching.
  Each "name" may contain several individual patterns each separated
  by spaces.
- The first input is used as a default, and is chosen only if no other
  input matches.

should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

Turns the node on and off.

selector

The value that the input names will be matched against.
Typically this will refer to a context variable using
the `${variableName}` syntax.
