Instancer
=========

Copies from an input scene onto the vertices of a target
object, making one copy per vertex. Additional primitive
variables on the target object can be used to choose between
multiple instances, and to specify their orientation and
scale. Note the target object will be removed from the scene.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

parent
------

The object on which to make the instances. The
position, orientation and scale of the instances
are taken from per-vertex primitive variables on
this object. This is ignored when a filter is
connected, in which case the filter specifies
multiple objects to make the instances from.

name
----

The name of the location the instances will be
generated below. This will be parented directly
under the parent location.

instances
---------

The scene containing the instances to be applied to
each vertex. Specify multiple instances by parenting
them at the root of the scene :

- /instance0
- /instance1
- /instance2

Note that the instances are not limited to being a
single object : they can each have arbitrary child
hierarchies.

index
-----

The name of a per-vertex integer primitive variable
used to determine which instance is applied to the
vertex. An index of 0 applies the first location from
the instances scene, an index of 1 applies the second
and so on.

id
--

The name of a per-vertex integer primitive variable
used to give each instance a unique identity. This
is useful when points are added and removed over time,
as is often the case in a particle simulation. The
id is used to name the instance in the output scene.

position
--------

The name of the per-vertex primitive variable used
to specify the position of each instance.

orientation
-----------

The name of the per-vertex primitive variable used
to specify the orientation of each instance. This
must be provided as a quaternion : use an upstream
Orientation node to convert from other representations
before instancing.

scale
-----

The name of the per-vertex primitive variable used
to specify the scale of each instance. Scale can be
provided as a float for uniform scaling, or as a vector
to define different scaling in each axis.

attributes
----------

The names of per-vertex primitive variables to be
turned into per-instance attributes. Names should
be separated by spaces and can use Gaffer's
standard wildcards.

attributePrefix
---------------

A prefix added to all per-instance attributes specified
via the "attributes" plug.
