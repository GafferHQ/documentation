VectorWarp
==========

Warps an input image onto a set of UVs provided
by a second image, effectively applying a texture
map to the UV image.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image

boundingMode
------------

The method used when accessing pixels outside the
input data window.

filter
------

The filter used to perform the resampling. The name
of any OIIO filter may be specified, but this UI
only exposes a limited range of 4 options which perform
well for warping, ordered from softest to sharpest.

useDerivatives
--------------

Whether accurate filter sizes should be computed that take into account the amount
of distortion in the size and shape of pixels.  Should have minimal impact on warps
that mostly preserve the size of pixels, but could have a large impact if there is
heavy distortion.  Fixes problems with aliasing, at the cost of some extra calculations.

vector
------

The UV image. The R and G channel are used to provide
the U and V values, and these determine the source pixel
in the main input image. A UV values of ( 0, 0 ) corresponds
to the bottom left corner of the input image, and ( 1, 1 )
corresponds to the top right corner.

vectorMode
----------

Do vectors specify absolute positions in the source image, or relative
offsets from the current pixel to the pixel in the source image.

vectorUnits
-----------

Are vectors measured in pixels, or as fractions of the input image display
window ranging from 0 to 1.
