Fixes
-----

- OSLShader : Fixed loading of `mx_invert_float` shaders. These were renamed to `mx_invert_float_float` in the OpenShadingLanguage project.
- PythonEditor : Fixed bug where the input widget didn't scroll to show the new line when <kbd>Return</kbd> was pressed.
- TypedObjectPlug : Fixed bug in the serialisation of some `IECore.CompoundObject` values (the necessary `import IECore` was sometimes missing). This was particularly likely to affect CustomAttributes nodes where the `extraAttributes` plug was used.
