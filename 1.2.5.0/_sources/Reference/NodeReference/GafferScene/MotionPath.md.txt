MotionPath
==========

Creates a motion path curve over the specified frame range for each filtered location.
Note the output scene will be isolated to the matching locations only.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

start
-----

The first frame of motion tracking can be specified relative to the current frame or as an absolute value.

start.mode
----------

Controls whether `start.frame` is relative to the current frame or an absolute value. 

start.frame
-----------

The first frame of motion tracking.

end
---

The last frame of motion tracking can be specified relative to the current frame or as an absolute value.

end.mode
--------

Controls whether `end.frame` is relative to the current frame or an absolute value.

end.frame
---------

The last frame of motion tracking.

samplingMode
------------

Use "Fixed" mode for a curve with a constant vertex count.

Use "Variable" mode for a curve sampled at regular `step` intervals.

> Note : This curve may have a changing vertex count over a frame range.

> Caution : In "Variable" mode it may not be possible to render with
deformation blur enabled. Be sure to disable it via `StandardAttributes`
if you want to render a variable sampled curve. 

step
----

The sampling rate between `start.frame` and `end.frame`.

> Note : `start.frame` and `end.frame` will always be sampled
even if the `step` does not exactly fit the range.

> Caution : With a small `step` size it may not be possible to render
with deformation blur enabled. 

samples
-------

The exact number of samples (including `start.frame` and `end.frame`) when using a "Fixed" `samplingMode`.

adjustBounds
------------

Opt in or out of bounds calculations.
