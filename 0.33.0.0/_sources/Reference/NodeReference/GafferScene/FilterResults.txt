FilterResults
=============

Searches an input scene for all locations matched
by a filter.

> Warning : This can be an arbitrarily expensive operation
depending on the size of the input scene and the filter
used. In particular it should be noted that the usage of
`...` in a PathFilter will cause the entire input scene to
be searched even if there are no matches to be found.
