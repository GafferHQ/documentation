Camera

Produces scenes containing a camera. To choose which camera is
used for rendering, use a StandardOptions node.

should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs
an empty scene.

The name of the object in the output scene.

names should be separated by spaces.

as defined in the RenderMan specification. This is only
