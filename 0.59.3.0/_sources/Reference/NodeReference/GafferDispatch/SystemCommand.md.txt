SystemCommand
=============

Runs system commands via a shell.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

preTasks
--------

Input connections to upstream nodes which must be
executed before this node.

postTasks
---------

Input connections to nodes which must be
executed after this node, but which don't
need to be executed before downstream nodes.

task
----

Output connections to downstream nodes which must
not be executed until after this node.

dispatcher
----------

Container for custom plugs which dispatchers use to
control their behaviour.

dispatcher.batchSize
--------------------

Maximum number of frames to batch together when dispatching tasks.

dispatcher.immediate
--------------------

Causes this node to be executed immediately upon dispatch,
rather than have its execution be scheduled normally by
the dispatcher. For instance, when using the LocalDispatcher,
the node will be executed immediately in the dispatching process
and not in a background process as usual.

When a node is made immediate, all upstream nodes are automatically
considered to be immediate too, regardless of their settings.

command
-------

The command to be run. This may reference values
from substitutions with '{substitutionName}' syntax.

shell
-----

When enabled, the specified command is interpreted as a shell
command and run in a child shell. This allows semantics such
as pipes to be used.  Otherwise the supplied command is invoked
directly as an executable and its args.

> Note: On MacOS with System Integrity Protection enabled, child
> shells will not inherit `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` from the Gaffer
> process. If the executable you are running relies on this,
> disabling _shell_ should allow it to inherit the full Gaffer
> environment.

substitutions
-------------

An arbitrary set of name/value pairs which can be
referenced in command with '{substitutionsName}' syntax.

environmentVariables
--------------------

An arbitrary set of name/value pairs which will be set as
environment variables when running the command.
