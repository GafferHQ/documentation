Dot
===

A utility node which can be used for organising large graphs.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

labelType
---------

The method used to apply an optional label
to the dot. Using a node name is recommended,
because it encourages the use of descriptive node
names, and updates automatically when nodes are
renamed or upstream connections change. The custom
label does however provide more flexibility, since
node names are restricted in the characters they
can use.

label
-----

The label displayed when the type is set to custom.
