CopyPrimitiveVariables
======================

Copies primitive variables from a source scene, adding them to the objects
of the main input scene.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

adjustBounds
------------

Adjusts bounding boxes to account for the changes made to the object.

> Caution : Adjusting boundings boxes has a performance penalty.
> If you do not need accurate bounds or you know that the bounds
> will only change slightly, you may prefer to turn this off.

source
------

The scene from which the primitive variables are copied.

primitiveVariables
------------------

The names of the primitive variables to be copied. These should be
separated by spaces and can use Gaffer's standard wildcards
to match multiple variables.

sourceLocation
--------------

The location in the source scene that primitive variables are copied from.
By default, variables are copied from the location equivalent to the one
they are being copied to. It is not an error if the location to be copied from
does not exist; instead, no variables are copied.

prefix
------

A prefix applied to the names of the copied primitive variables.

ignoreIncompatible
------------------

Causes the node to not error when attempting to copy primitive variables from
the source object that are not compatible with the destination object.
