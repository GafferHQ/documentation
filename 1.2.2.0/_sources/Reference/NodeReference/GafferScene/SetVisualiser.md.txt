SetVisualiser
=============

Visualises Set membership values by applying a custom shader and coloring
based on which sets each object belongs to. Membership of more than one set
is visualised by a stripe pattern.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

sets
----

A space separated list of sets to consider membership of. This
supports wild cards, eg: asset:* to allow membership display to
focus on a specific group of sets. Right-click to insert the name
of any sets in the input scene.

includeInherited
----------------

When enabled, objects that inherit Set membership from their parents
will also be coloured. Disabling this will only color objects that
are exactly matched by any given Set.

stripeWidth
-----------

The thickness (in pixels) of the stripes used to indicate an object
is in more than one set.

colorOverrides
--------------

Allows the randomly generated set colors to be overridden by
specific colors to use for Sets matching the supplied filter. This
can be a name, or a match string.
