SetQuery
========

Queries the set memberships of a location, and outputs a list of
the sets that it belongs to.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

scene
-----

The scene to query.

location
--------

The location to query the set memberships for.

sets
----

The sets to query.

inherit
-------

When on, locations are treated as being in a set if an
ancestor location is in that set.

matches
-------

The list of sets that the `location` is a member of. Returned in the
order they are listed in the `sets` plug.

firstMatch
----------

The first set from the `matches` output, or `""` if there were no matches.
This is particularly convenient for use in a Spreadsheet's selector, to
select rows based on the set membership of a location.
