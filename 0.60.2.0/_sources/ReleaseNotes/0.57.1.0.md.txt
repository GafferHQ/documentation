0.57.1.0
========

Features
--------

- ClosestPointSampler : Added a new node for sampling primitive variables from the closest point on a source primitive.
- CurveSampler : Added a new node for sampling primitive variables from parametric positions on some source curves.
- ArnoldColorManager : Added a new node for specifying the colour manager for use in Arnold renders ([#3523](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3523)).
- Viewer : Added overlay to Image views to control interactive renders where available ([#3419](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3419)).

Improvements
------------

- Spreadsheet : Added a popup menu item for promoting spreadsheet plugs.
- InteractiveRender : Improved presentation of render control buttons ([#3419](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3419)).

Fixes
-----

- Spreadsheet : Fixed pattern matching bugs when using `${scene:path}` as the selector. In this case, `*` no longer matches `/`, and `...` is now supported.
- TranslateTool : Fixed problems translating an object with a downstream AimConstraint applied.
- Instancer : Fixed crashes caused by attempts to instance onto a location without a primitive ([#3715](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3715)).
- Script Settings :
  - Fixed errors showing the popup menu for the `frameRange` plug.
  - Fixed Spreadsheet menu items.
- UI : Fixed appearance of button icons when disabled.
- FilterResults : Fixed the UI to show the connected filter instead of a meaningless numeric value. This also avoids triggering spurious errors on PathFilter nodes.
- Viewer :
  - Fixed crash displaying and/or manipulating objects with zero scale transform components.
  - Fixed EditScope menu to include scopes nested inside Boxes.
  - Fixed EditScope menu button so it updates when the EditScope is renamed.
- NodeAlgo : Fixed bugs that prevented visitation of nodes nested inside Boxes.
- ColorSwatch : Fixed highlighted appearance ([#3735](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/3735)).

API
---

- PrimitiveSampler : Added a new base class for nodes which sample primitive variables using an `IECoreScene::PrimitiveEvaluator`.
- Arnold Renderer : Added support for an `ai:color_manager` option.
