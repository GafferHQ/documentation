0.66.0
======

* Fixed interactive display.
* Fixed APIs to make UI resources per-application. When applications are updated to use these new APIS, they will no longer pollute each other's interfaces ([#351](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/351), [#225](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/225)).
* Refactored GafferImage::Filter to have a better interface whilst removing the need for the construct() method.
* Added python bindings and enhancements for the GafferImage::Filter class.
* Fixed hash() bug in RenderMan coshader, which in turn fixes an interactive rerendering bug.
* Reduced occurences of accidental connection snatching ([#313](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/313), [#325](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/325)).
* Fixed escape-to-close menu bug.
* Added an ImageStats node.
* Fixed deadlock when writing image files to disk.
* Op. Procedural and RenderMan shader menus may now be filtered to show fewer options.
* Added "cmd" parameter to screen grab app.
* Fixed GafferImage::FormatPlug::hash()
* Fixed duplicate typename errors ([#330](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/330)).
* Prevented promotion of non-serialisable plugs to Box level ([#347](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/347)).
* Fixed a bug in ImageProcessor that was causing a segfault when the node has an output that is not an ImagePlug.
