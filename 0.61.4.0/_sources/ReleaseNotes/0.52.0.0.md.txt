0.52.0.0
========

This release brings a major overhaul to Gaffer's camera definition, bringing more
flexibility and improved compatibility with USD and Alembic. Note that if you were
previously using a Parameters node to add a "screenWindow" parameter, you should
now manipulate the standard aperture and film fit settings instead.

Features
--------

- Camera : Adopted new camera definition ([#2816](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2816))
  - Added perspectiveMode, with "Field of View" and "Aperture and Focal Length"
    modes.
  - Added aperture settings.
  - Added depth of field settings.
  - Added optional render overrides that override the StandardOptions settings on
    a per-camera basis.
  - Improved compatibility with USD and Alembic.
- CameraTweaks : Added new node to apply downstream edits to camera parameters ([#2816](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2816)).
- StandardOptions : Added filmFit render option ([#2816](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2816)).

Fixes
-----

- Restored FilterSwitch/UnionFilter compatibility for files from version 0.27.0.0 ([#2854](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2854)).
- SceneGadget : Fixed depth sorting for `objectAt()` when used with some legacy
  graphics drivers ([#2816](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2816)).
- Fixed overzealous dirty propagation in several nodes. These could cause unnecessary
  viewer and/or interactive render updates.
    - SceneElementProcessor ([#2855](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2855))
    - ImageNode ([#2855](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2855))
    - Switch ([#2859](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2859))
- OpenGLRenderer : Fixed GL resource management threading bug. This was the cause of
  rare crashes when collapsing locations in the viewer ([#2851](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2851)).
- Documentation : Fixed broken link ([#2857](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2857)).

API
---

- PlugAlgo : Added `createPlugFromData()` and `extractDataFromPlug()` methods ([#2816](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2816)).
- ViewportGadget : Added `set/getPlanarMovement()` methods ([#2816](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2816)).
- Packaged IECorePreview and IECoreScenePreview headers. Note that these are subject to
  change without notice ([#2862](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2862)).

Breaking Changes
----------------

- CompoundDataPlug : Removed `createPlugFromData()` and `extractDataFromPlug()` methods ([#2816](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2816)).
  Use PlugAlgo instead ([#2816](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2816)).
- RendererAlgo : Added `scene` argument to `applyCameraGlobals()` ([#2816](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2816)).
- ViewportGadget : Removed `set/getOrthographic3D()` methods. Use `set/getPlanarMovement()`
  instead ([#2816](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2816)).
- SceneAlgo : Added `scene` argument to `shutter()` method ([#2816](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2816)).
- Camera : Adopted new camera definition ([#2816](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2816)). In particular, if you were using a "screenWindow"
  parameter, you will now need to use aperture and/or filmFit instead.
