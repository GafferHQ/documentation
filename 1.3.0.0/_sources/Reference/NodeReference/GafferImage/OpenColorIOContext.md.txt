OpenColorIOContext
==================

Creates Gaffer context variables which define the OpenColorIO config
to be used by upstream nodes. This allows different configs to be used
in different contexts.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

config
------

The OpenColorIO config to use.

config.enabled
--------------

Enables the `config.value` plug, allowing the OpenColorIO config
to be specified.

config.value
------------

Specifies the OpenColorIO config to be used.

workingSpace
------------

Specifies the color space in which Gaffer processes images.

workingSpace.enabled
--------------------

Enables the `workingSpace.value` plug, allowing the working space
to be specified.

workingSpace.value
------------------

Specifies the working color space to be used.

variables
---------

Context variables used to customise the
[OpenColorIO context](https://opencolorio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/authoring/overview.html#environment)
used by upstream nodes. OpenColorIO refers to these variously as "string vars", "context vars" or
"environment vars".

extraVariables
--------------

An additional set of variables to be created. These are defined as
key/value pairs in an `IECore::CompoundData` object, which
allows a single expression to define a dynamic number of variables.

If the same variable is defined by both the `variables` and the
`extraVariables` plugs, then the value from the `variables` plug
is taken.
