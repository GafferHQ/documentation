1.2.7.0
=======

Improvements
------------

- SceneReader :
  - Improved performance when reading sets from USD compositions with many instances.
  - Improved performance when reading materials from USD instances.
  - Removed `scene:path` and `scene:setName` variables from context used to evaluate `fileName`, `refreshCount` and `tags` plugs. This prevents logical impossibilities like changing the file per location, and also reduces pressure on the hash cache.
  - Improved performance when USD files are queried for sets which don't exist. This can be a substantial improvement when a complex USD file without sets is used within a node graph which adds many sets downstream.

Fixes
-----

- SceneReader : Fixed loading of `__cameras`, `__lights` and `usd:pointInstancers` sets from USD instances.
- Gaffer module : Delayed loading of config files until the Gaffer module is completely defined.

API
---

- SceneReader : Added environment variables to control cache policies.
  - `GAFFERSCENE_SCENEREADER_OBJECT_CACHEPOLICY` controls the policy for objects.
  - `GAFFERSCENE_SCENEREADER_SETNAMES_CACHEPOLICY` controls the policy for set names.
  - `GAFFERSCENE_SCENEREADER_SET_CACHEPOLICY` controls the policy for sets.
  - Default policies remain unchanged, but `Standard` policy may yield improved performance and
    reduced memory usage for Alembic or USD files making heavy use of instancing.

Build
-----

- Cortex : Updated to 10.4.9.0.
