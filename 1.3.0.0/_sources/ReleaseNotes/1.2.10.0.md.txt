Fixes
-----

- Instancer : Fixed bug that could cause the `scene:path` context variable to be leaked into the evaluation of `prototypes.set` in rare circumstances.
- NumericPlugValueWidget ([#5335](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5335)) :
  - Fixed bug causing the cursor position to be reset to the end if the number of digits in the plug value changed while incrementing/decrementing with the keyboard up/down arrow keys.
  - Fixed bug causing the cursor position to be reset to the end when incrementing an animated plug.
  - Fixed intermittent `---` values when drag-changing an animated plug value.
- EditScopes : Fixed bug where the enabled state of `AttributeEdits`, `OptionEdits` and `SetMembershipEdits` did not have any effect. This fix will only apply to newly created `AttributeEdits`, `OptionEdits` and `SetMembershipEdits`.
