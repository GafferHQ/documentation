LUT
===

Applies color transformations provided by
OpenColorIO via a LUT file and OCIO FileTransform.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image

channels
--------

The names of the channels to process. Names should be
separated by spaces and can use Gaffer's standard
wildcards.

processUnpremultiplied
----------------------

Unpremultiplies data before processing, and premultiply again after processing.  This allows
accurate processing of nodes that deal with color, when running on partially transparent or
deep images.

fileName
--------

The name of the LUT file to be read. Only OpenColorIO
supported files will function as expected.

**Supported file extensions** : 3dl, 3dl, cc, ccc, cdl, clf, ctf, csp, lut, lut, icc, icm, pf, cube, itx, look, mga, m3d, cube, spi1d, spi3d, spimtx, cub, vf

interpolation
-------------

The interpolation mode for the color transformation.

direction
---------

The direction to perform the color transformation.
