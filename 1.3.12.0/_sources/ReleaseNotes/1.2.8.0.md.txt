1.2.8.0
=======

Improvements
------------

- ArnoldAttributes : Added `pointsMinPixelWidth` plug.
- EditScope : Hid the `BoxIn.name` and `BoxOut.name` plugs from the NodeEditor, since it is not editable and the name is _always_ `in` or `out` respectively.
- Limits : Increased soft file handle limit (`RLIMIT_NOFILE`) to match the hard limit (Linux only).
- SceneReader :
  - Fixed `I/O Exception` errors triggered by closing and reopening the same USD file.
  - Increased the default limit for the number of open files to 2000 (or 25% of the file handle limit, whichever is lowest).

Fixes
-----

- NodeEditor : Reverted change that prevented a plug being unlocked if static `readOnly` metadata was registered against it.
- EditMenu : Fixed errors using "Duplicate with Inputs" with certain configurations of Dot node ([#5309](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5309)).
- Dot : Fixed the display of context-sensitive `label` values ([#5330](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5330)).

API
---

- CatalogueUI : Made ImageListing widget public so it can be customized using the API.
