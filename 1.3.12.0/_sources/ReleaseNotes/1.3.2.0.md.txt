Fixes
-----

- Viewer :
  - Fixed crash when visualising lights with a light filter intended for a different renderer.
  - Fixed visualisation of Cycles point light size.
  - Fixed visualisation of Arnold light gobo textures with scaled UV coordinates.
- Arnold :
  - Fixed screen window export for Lentil cameras.
  - Fixed writing of image metadata for empty strings and strings containing spaces. This fixes the `malformed line "string 'gaffer:context:ocio:config'"` warning.
- Application : Fixed the `-threads` argument to clamp the number of threads to the number of available hardware cores ([#5403](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5403)).
- CompareFloat, CompareColor, CompareVector : Worked around crashes in OSL's batched shading system ([#5430](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5430)).
- PlugValueWidget : Fixed search for auxiliary plugs of output plugs. In this case, the inputs are now searched instead of the outputs.
- GafferUI : Fixed TableView bug causing the horizontal scrollbar to potentially overlap the last row ([#5328](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5328)).
- Dispatch App : Fixed bug that prevented setting specific dispatcher plug values from the command line ([#5434](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5434)).

API
---

- ThreadMonitor : Added new class for tracking the threads used to perform processes.
- PlugAlgo : Added `findSource()` method.
- TestRunner :
  - Added `CategorisedTestMethod` decorator used to assign categories to test methods.
  - Added `categories()` static method to return the list of available categories in a test suite.
  - Added `filterCategories()` static method to skip tests according to included and excluded categories.
