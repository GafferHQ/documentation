========

> Caution : A performance enhancement introduced in BranchCreator may reveal latent bugs in derived classes.
> If a derived class implements `computeBranchSet()` it is now essential that it also implements
> `computeBranchSetNames()` appropriately. It is no longer sufficient to rely on the set names existing on
> the main input.

Improvements
------------

- Stats app :
  - Added `-context` argument to specify additional context variables for the processes being measured.
  - Improved accuracy of timings produced by `-scene` and `-image`.
- CameraTool : Improved performance when moving lights/cameras in look-through mode.
- Instancer/Parent :
  - Improved performance when computing sets which do not exist on the prototypes/children.
  - Improved interactive performance by reducing likelihood of cache eviction for set hashes.
- SetFilter : Improved interactive performance for CameraTool/TransformTool by enabling use of cached values.

Fixes
-----

- Viewer :
  - Fixed bug that caused the Inspector to grow very wide when inspecting long strings.
  - Fixed bug that caused a second click to be required to apply edits when closing an Inspector edit window by clicking outside the popup.
- NumericPlugValueWidget : Fixed bug that caused plug values to be set to 0 if editing completed with invalid text.
- StringPlugValueWidget : Fixed bug that could cause plug values to be overwritten when editing multiple plugs and focus was lost without change, or the value state changed to mixed via external action.
- TypedObjectPlug : Fixed serialisation of values for which `repr()` is not available ([#106](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/106)).
- Editor : Fixed bug that caused child widgets to lose focus when the mouse re-enters an Editor that already has focus.
- Stats app : The `-canceller` argument is now honoured when using `-task` to measure task execution time.

API
---

- Serialisation : Added `objectToBase64()` and `objectFromBase64()` methods to provide base64 encoding and decoding for all `IECore::Objects`.
- NumericWidget : Fixed bug that caused `editingFinished` to be called with the wrong `reason` when the widget was left with an invalid value. `Invalid` is now passed in these cases.
- PlugValueWidget : Improved support for legacy widgets in `PlugValueWidget.create` when used to create widgets for single plugs supplied in a set.
- NameLabel : Added support for multiple graph components in the constructor, added `setGraphComponents`/`getGraphComponents` methods.
- LabelPlugValueWidget, NameValuePlugValuePlug : Added support for multiple plugs.
- SceneAlgo : Added Python binding for `historyIDContextName()`. Woe betide you if you find a need for it.
