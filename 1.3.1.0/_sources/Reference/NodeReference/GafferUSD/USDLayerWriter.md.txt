USDLayerWriter
==============

Takes two input scenes and writes a minimal USD file containing the
differences between them. This new file can then be layered in a USD
composition to transform the first scene into the second. This is useful for
baking modifications made in Gaffer into a USD file for consumption in other
hosts.

A typical use case might be to share lookdev authored in Gaffer, with a
workflow like the following :

- A SceneReader brings `model.usd` into Gaffer.
- Shaders and attributes are applied in Gaffer, using Gaffer's standard scene
  processing nodes.
- A USDLayerWriter is used to bake this lookdev into a new `look.usd` layer on
  disk, with the SceneReader for `model.usd` connected to the `base` input
  and the lookdev connected into the `layer` input.
- A new USD file is created that layers `look.usd` over `model.usd`. This is
  loaded into Gaffer or another host for lighting.

> Note : To write a complete USD file (rather than a layer containing differences)
> use the standard SceneWriter node.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

preTasks
--------

Input connections to upstream nodes which must be
executed before this node.

postTasks
---------

Input connections to nodes which must be
executed after this node, but which don't
need to be executed before downstream nodes.

task
----

Output connections to downstream nodes which must
not be executed until after this node.

dispatcher
----------

Container for custom plugs which dispatchers use to
control their behaviour.

dispatcher.batchSize
--------------------

Maximum number of frames to batch together when dispatching tasks.
If the node requires sequence execution `batchSize` will be ignored.

dispatcher.immediate
--------------------

Causes this node to be executed immediately upon dispatch,
rather than have its execution be scheduled normally by
the dispatcher. For instance, when using the LocalDispatcher,
the node will be executed immediately in the dispatching process
and not in a background process as usual.

When a node is made immediate, all upstream nodes are automatically
considered to be immediate too, regardless of their settings.

base
----

The base scene that the `layer` input is compared to.

layer
-----

The scene to be written to `fileName`. This is compared to the
`base` scene, and only differences are written to the file.

fileName
--------

The name of the USD file to be written.

**Supported file extensions** : usd, usda, usdc

out
---

A direct pass-through of the `layer` input.
