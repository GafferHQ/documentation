CustomAttributes
================

Applies arbitrary user-defined attributes to locations in the scene. Note
that for most common cases the StandardAttributes, OpenGLAttributes, RenderManAttributes,
and ArnoldAttributes nodes should be used in preference - they provide predefined
sets of attributes with customised user interfaces. The CustomAttributes node is of most use when
needing to set a custom attribute not supported by the specialised nodes.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

attributes
----------

The attributes to be applied - arbitrary numbers of user defined
attributes may be added as children of this plug via the user
interface, or using the CompoundDataPlug API via python.

global
------

Causes the attributes to be applied to the scene globals
instead of the individual locations defined by the filter.
