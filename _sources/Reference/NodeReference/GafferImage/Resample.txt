Resample
========

Utility node used internally within GafferImage, but
not intended to be used directly by end users.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image

matrix
------

The transform to be applied to the input image.
This must contain only translation and scaling.

filter
------

The filter used to perform the resampling. The name
of any OIIO filter may be specified. The default automatically
picks an appropriate high-quality filter based on whether
or not the image is being enlarged or reduced.

filterWidth
-----------

An override for the width of the filter used. This is
specified as a number of pixels in the output image. The
default value of 0 causes a good default width to be
picked based on the filter type.

boundingMode
------------

The method used when a filter references pixels outside the
input data window.

expandDataWindow
----------------

Expands the data window by the filter radius, to include the
external pixels affected by the filter.

debug
-----

Enables debug output. The HorizontalPass setting outputs
an intermediate image filtered just in the horizontal
direction - this is an internal optimisation used when
filtering with a separable filter. The SinglePass setting
forces all filtering to be done in a single pass (as if
the filter was non-separable) and can be used for validating
the results of the the two-pass (default) approach.
