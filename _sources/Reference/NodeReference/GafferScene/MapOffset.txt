MapOffset
=========

Adds an offset to object texture coordinates. This provides a convenient way of
looking at specific texture UDIMs.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

offset
------

An offset added to the texture coordinates. Note that moving the
texture coordinates in the positive direction will move the texture
in the negative direction.

udim
----

A specific UDIM to offset the texture coordinates to. The UDIM is
converted to an offset which is added to the offset above.

uvSet
-----

The name of the primitive variable holding the UV coordinates.
