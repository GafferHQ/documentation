DeletePrimitiveVariables
========================

Deletes primitive variables from objects. The primitive
variables to be deleted are chosen based on name.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

names
-----

The names of the primitive variables to be affected.
Names should be separated by spaces, and Gaffer's
standard wildcard characters may be used.

invertNames
-----------

When on, the primitive variables matched by names
are unaffected, and the non-matching primitive
variables are affected instead.
