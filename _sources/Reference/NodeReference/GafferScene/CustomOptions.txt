CustomOptions
=============

Applies arbitrary user-defined options to the root of the scene. Note
that for most common cases the StandardOptions or renderer-specific options
nodes should be preferred, as they provide predefined sets of options with customised
user interfaces. The CustomOptions node is of most use when needing to set am
option not supported by the specialised nodes.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in

The input scene

options
-------

The options to be applied - arbitrary numbers of user defined options may be added
as children of this plug via the user interface, or using the CompoundDataPlug API via
python.

prefix
------

A prefix applied to the name of each option. For example, a prefix
of "myCategory:" and a name of "test" will create an option named
"myCategory:test".
