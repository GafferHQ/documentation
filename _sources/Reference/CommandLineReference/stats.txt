stats
=====

Outputs statistics about a Gaffer script, including the version of
Gaffer that created it, the values of all setting and variables and
the types of node in use. May also be used to perform performance
analysis of image and scene processing nodes within the script, using
a performance monitor to generate advanced statistics.

To output basic information about a script :

```
gaffer stats fileName.gfr
```

To run a scene processing node using the performance monitor :

```
gaffer stats fileName.gfr -scene NameOfNode -performanceMonitor
```

To run an image processing node using the performance monitor :

```
gaffer stats fileName.gfr -image NameOfNode -performanceMonitor
```

-help
-----

Prints names and descriptions of each parameter rather than running the application.

-threads
--------

The maximum number of threads used for computation. The default value of zero causes the number of threads to  be chosen automatically based on the available hardware.

-profileFileName
----------------

If this is specified, then the application is run using the cProfile profiling module, and the results saved to the file for later examination.

-script
-------

The script to examine.

-outputFile
-----------

Output the results to this file on disk rather than stdout

-frame
------

The frame to evaluate statistics at.

-nodeSummary
------------

Turns on a summary of nodes in the script.

-scene
------

The name of a SceneNode or ScenePlug to examine.

-image
------

The name of an ImageNode or ImagePlug to examine.

-preCache
---------

Prepopulates the cache by evaluating the scene or image once prior to measuring the second evaluation.

-task
-----

The name of a TaskNode or TaskPlug to dispatch.

-performanceMonitor
-------------------

Turns on a performance monitor to provide additional statistics about the operation of the node graph.

-maxLinesPerMetric
------------------

The maximum number of plugs to list for each metric captured by the performance monitor.

-contextMonitor
---------------

Turns on a context monitor to provide additional statistics about the operation of the node graph.

-contextMonitorRoot
-------------------

The name of a node or plug to provide a root for the context monitor. Statistics will only be captured for this root downwards.

-vtune
------

enable vtune instrumentation. When enabled the VTune profile 'Tasks & Frames' view will be broken down by node type.
