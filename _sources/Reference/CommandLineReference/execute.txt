execute
=======

Executes task nodes such as ImageWriters, SystemCommands and Render nodes
from within a .gfr file. This is used by Gaffer's dispatchers when executing
nodes in a background process or on a render farm, but can also be used to
perform a manual execution from the command line.

Example usage :

```
gaffer execute -script comp.gfr -nodes ImageWriter -frames 1-10
```

-help
-----

Prints names and descriptions of each parameter rather than running the application.

-threads
--------

The maximum number of threads used for computation. The default value of zero causes the number of threads to  be chosen automatically based on the available hardware.

-profileFileName
----------------

If this is specified, then the application is run using the cProfile profiling module, and the results saved to the file for later examination.

-script
-------

The script to execute.

-ignoreScriptLoadErrors
-----------------------

Causes errors which occur while loading the script to be ignored. Not recommended.

-nodes
------

The names of the nodes to execute. If not specified then all executable nodes will be found automatically.

-frames
-------

The frames to execute. The default value executes the current frame as stored in the script.

-context
--------

The context used during execution. Note that the frames parameter will be used to vary the context frame entry.
