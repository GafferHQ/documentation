env
===

Runs shell commands in the Gaffer environment
(after the Gaffer wrapper has been run), so they have access
to all the libraries and modules available within Gaffer.

This is useful for running the binary utilities supplied with Gaffer,
or for running python scripts which need to import Gaffer's python
modules.

Usage :

```
gaffer env [name=value ...] [utility [argument ...]]
```

Examples :

```
gaffer env maketx input.exr
gaffer env python script.py
```
