stats
=====

Prints statistics about a Gaffer script, including the version of
Gaffer that created it, the values of all setting and variables and
the types of node in use. May also be used to perform performance
analysis of image and scene processing nodes within the script, using
a performance monitor to generate advanced statistics.

To print basic information about a script :

```
gaffer stats fileName.gfr
```

To run a scene processing node using the performance monitor :

```
gaffer stats fileName.gfr -scene NameOfNode -performanceMonitor
```

To run an image processing node using the performance monitor :

```
gaffer stats fileName.gfr -image NameOfNode -performanceMonitor
```

-threads
--------

The maximum number of threads used for computation. The default value of zero causes the number of threads to  be chosen automatically based on the available hardware.

-profileFileName
----------------

If this is specified, then the application is run using the cProfile profiling module, and the results saved to the file for later examination.

-script
-------

The script to examine.

-frame
------

The frame to evaluate statistics at.

-scene
------

The name of a SceneNode or ScenePlug to examine.

-image
------

The name of an ImageNode or ImagePlug to examine.

-performanceMonitor
-------------------

Turns on a performance monitor to provide additionalstatistics about the operation of the node graph.

-maxLinesPerMetric
------------------

The maximum number of plugs to list for each metric captured by the performance monitor.
