UDIMQuery
=========

Gathering information about what UDIMs are present in meshes matching
the input scene and filter, and which meshes they belong to.

The output is a three level dictionary ( stored as CompoundObjects ), containing information about the selected UDIMs.

The keys of the top level are all the UDIMs containing part of the target meshes.
The keys of the second level are the meshes which touch that UDIM.
The keys of the third level are any attributes on that mesh which match extraAttributes, and the values of the third-level dictionary are the attribute values.

An example result, with two udims, and "attributes" set to "bake:resolution", might look like this:

```
{
                "1001" : {
                         "/mesh1" : { "bake:resolution", 512 },
                         "/mesh2" : { "bake:resolution", 1024 },
                },
                "1002" : {
                         "/mesh1" : { "bake:resolution", 512 },
                },
}
```

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

in
--

The scene to query UDIMs from.

uvSet
-----

The name of the primitive variable which drives the UVs to compute UDIMs from.
Should be a Face-Varying or Vertex interpolated V2f.

attributes
----------

A space separated list of attribute names ( may use wildcards ), to collect from meshes
which have UDIMs, and return as part of the output.  Inherited attributes are included.

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

out
---

A 3 level dictionary of results stored in a CompoundObject, as described in the node description.
