ShufflePrimitiveVariables
=========================

ShufflePrimitiveVariables is used to copy or rename arbitrary numbers of primitive variables
at the filtered locations. The deleteSource plugs may be used to remove the original source
primitive variable(s) after the shuffling has been completed.

An additional context variable "${source}" can be used on the destination plugs to insert
the name of each source primitive variable. For example, to prefix all primitive variables
with "user:" set the source to "*" and the destination to "user:${source}").

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

adjustBounds
------------

Adjusts bounding boxes to account for the changes made to the object.

> Caution : Adjusting boundings boxes has a performance penalty.
> If you do not need accurate bounds or you know that the bounds
> will only change slightly, you may prefer to turn this off.

shuffles
--------

The primitive variables to be shuffled - arbitrary numbers of primitive variables
may be shuffled via the source/destination plugs. The deleteSource plug may be used
to remove the original primitive variable(s).
