DeleteCurves
============

Delete curves from a curves primitive using a primitive variable to choose the curves.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

adjustBounds
------------

Adjusts bounding boxes to account for the changes made to the object.

> Caution : Adjusting boundings boxes has a performance penalty.
> If you do not need accurate bounds or you know that the bounds
> will only change slightly, you may prefer to turn this off.

curves
------

Uniformly interpolated int, float or bool primitive variable to choose which curves to delete. Note a non-zero value indicates the curve will be deleted.

invert
------

Invert the condition used to delete curves. If the primvar is zero then the curve will be deleted.
