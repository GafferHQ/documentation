1.1.4.0
=======

Improvements
------------

- Cycles : Added support for custom attributes with either a `user:` or `render:` prefix. These can be authored in Gaffer and then read at render time using Cycle's attribute shader.

Fixes
-----

- Catalogue : Fixed crashes when using the <kbd>↑</kbd> or <kbd>↓</kbd> keys immediately after adding or removing a column.
- PathListingWidget : Fixed bug tracking the last selected path, which could cause crashes if the path was deleted or the columns were changed.
- Image Viewer : Fixed dragging a color from the image view using a context with the wrong time, and an error that could show up when deleting the currently viewed image.
- Cycles :
  - Fixed background shader bug that could cause a crash, or cause the initial render in the Cycles viewport to be blank.
  - Fixed light bug that triggered an assertion in Cycles debug builds.
