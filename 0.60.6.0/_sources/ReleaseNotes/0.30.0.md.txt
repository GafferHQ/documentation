0.30.0
======

* Fixed problem trying to call QLineEdit.setPlaceholderText within Nuke.

* Gaffer.BlockedConnection now supports reentrancy, with the connection only becoming unblocked when the outermost block has been exited.

* Fixed bug which prevented selection using the up/down cursor keys from working in the PathChooserWidget.

* ImageGadgets now have a linear to srgb conversion applied when they are drawn. This means they now match the Image widget behaviour.

* PathChooserWidget and PathChooserDialogue now accept a new allowMultipleSelection argument to the constructor. Use the new PathChooserDialogue.waitForPaths() method to wait for paths selected in this way.

* VectorDataWidget has a new protected _createRows() method which may be overridden by derived classes to customise the addition of new rows. The PathVectorDataWidget implements this by displaying a dialogue where the user may select multiple paths to be added. This improves the parameter ui for PathVectorParameters.
