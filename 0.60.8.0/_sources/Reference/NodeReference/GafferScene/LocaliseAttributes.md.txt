LocaliseAttributes
==================

Copies inherited attributes into local attributes.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

attributes
----------

The names of the attributes to localise. These should be
separated by spaces and can use Gaffer's standard wildcards
to match multiple attributes.
