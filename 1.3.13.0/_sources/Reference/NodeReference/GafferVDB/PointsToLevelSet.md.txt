PointsToLevelSet
================

Converts a points primitive to an OpenVDB level set.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

width
-----

The name of a `float` primitive variable specifying the width of each point.
The primitive variable may have either `Vertex` or `Constant` interpolation.
If the primitive variable doesn't exist, a width of 1.0 is used.

> Note : A point's width needs to be at least 3x `voxelSize` to contribute to
> the level set. Smaller points will be ignored, and reported as a warning.

widthScale
----------

An additional multiplier on the width of each point.

useVelocity
-----------

Enables the creation of trails behind the points, based
on the `velocity` primitive variable.

velocity
--------

The name of a `V3f` primitive variable specifying the velocity
of each point. Velocity is specified in local-space units per
second, and the trail is automatically scaled to represent the
motion within a single frame.

velocityScale
-------------

An additional multiplier applied to the velocity of each point.

grid
----

Name of the level set grid to be created.

voxelSize
---------

Size of a voxel in the level set grid, specified in local space. Smaller voxel
sizes will increase resolution, but take more memory and computation time.

halfBandwidth
-------------

Defines the exterior and interior width of the level set in voxel units.
