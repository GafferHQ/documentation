MeshNormals
===========

Creates a normal primitive variable on a mesh, using the positions of adjacent vertices.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

interpolation
-------------

The interpolation of the normal primitive variable we are creating. Affects the shape of the resulting normals, because Uniform ( Per-Face ) normals are inherently faceted, whereas Vertex normals are always smooth.

weighting
---------

How to weight the multiple faces that contribute to the normal of a vertex.
"Equal" averages all faces connected to the vertex - simple to compute, but low quality.
"Angle" gives good results for most meshes.
"Area" may give good results on hard edge models with tight chamfers and large flat faces.

thresholdAngle
--------------

Used to decide whether edges are smooth or sharp when generating a normal primvar with FaceVarying
interpolation. FaceVertices with normals that differ by less than this angle will be averaged
together into a smooth normal.

position
--------

The name of the position primitive variable that drives everything.

normal
------

The name of the normal primitive variable to output.
