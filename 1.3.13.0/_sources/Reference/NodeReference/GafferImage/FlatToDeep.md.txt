FlatToDeep
==========

Sets the deep flag on a flat image, and makes sure that it has a Z channel ( and optionally a ZBack channel )
so that it can be used in deep compositing.

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

zMode
-----

Deep images must have a Z channel - it can be set either as a fixed depth, or using a channel.

depth
-----

A constant depth value to place the whole image at.

zChannel
--------

Uses this channel as a Z channel, defining the depth each pixel is at.

zBackMode
---------

Deep images may optionally have a ZBack channel - for transparent samples, this specifies
the depth range over which the opacity gradually increases from 0 to the alpha value.

thickness
---------

A constant thickness value for the whole image.  Transparent images will be
interpreted as fog where the density increases over this range.

zBackChannel
------------

Uses this channel as a ZBack channel, defining the end of the depth range for each
pixel.
