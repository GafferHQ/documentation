1.3.6.0
=======

Features
--------

- LightTool :
  - Added manipulator for disk and point light radii.
  - Added manipulators for cylinder length and radius.
- Tools Menu : Added "Metadata/Clean Up" menu item to optimise file size by removing redundant metadata.

Improvements
------------

- CollectScenes : Improved performance when computing sets, with a 3x speedup being seen in one particular benchmark.
- LightTool : Changed spot light and quad light edge tooltip locations so that they follow the cone and edge during drag.
- Arnold : Improved speed of translation of encapsulated scenes when using many threads.
- CollectImages : Added `addLayerPrefix` plug, to allow the layer prefix to be omitted in the case that the input images are already prefixed.
- OSL Expression : Added support for getting an element of an array context variable using `contextElement( variableName, index )` or `contextElement( variableName, index, defaultValue )`. Negative indices can be used to get elements relative to the end of the array.

Fixes
-----

- ValuePlug : Fixed hangs and poor performance caused by plugs depending on upstream plugs with an identical hash ([#4978](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/4978)).
- Filter : Fixed bug which allowed the `scene:path` context variable to "leak" upstream via the `Filter.enabled` plug. This caused unnecessary evaluations of the input, and also provided a loophole via which the filter result could be made inconsistent with respect to descendant and ancestor matches.
- Windows :
  - Fixed a bug preventing anything except strings from being copied and pasted.
  - Fixed likely cause of crash when resizing Spreadsheet column width ([#5296](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5296)).
- Reference : Fixed rare reloading error.
- PlugLayout : Fixed lack of update when `layout:customWidget:*` metadata changes.
- Dispatch app : Removed unnecessary and misleading "Execute" button.
- SceneAlgo : Fixed history queries for `ScenePlug.object` in networks with nodes derived from `ObjectProcessor`. These include : `CameraTweaks`, `ClosestPointSampler`, `CollectPrimitiveVariables`, `CopyPrimitiveVariables`, `CurveSampler`, `DeleteCurves`, `DeleteFaces`, `DeletePoints`, `MapOffset`, `MapProjection`, `MeshDistortion`, `MeshNormals`, `MeshSegments`, `MeshTangents`, `MeshToPoints`, `MeshType`, `Orientation`, `PointsType`, `PrimitiveSampler`, `PrimitiveVariables`, `ReverseWinding`, `ShufflePrimitiveVariables` and `UVSampler` ([#5406](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5406)).
- Metadata : Fixed redundant copying of metadata when promoting plugs.
- OpenColorIO : Fixed hang when opening a script which didn't yet have the `openColorIO.config` plug.
- Context : Fixed bug preventing the retrieval of `V2iVectorData`, `V2fVectorData`, `V3iVectorData` and `V3fVectorData` from a context.

API
---

- Process : Added `acquireCollaborativeResult()` method, providing an improved mechanism for multiple threads to collaborate on TBB tasks spawned by a single process they all depend on.
- ValuePlug : Added `Default` CachePolicy and deprecated `Standard`, `TaskIsolation` and `Legacy` policies.
- Metadata :
  - Added `RegistrationTypes` enum that allows the different types of registrations to be identified.
  - Added improved `registeredValues()` and `value()` overloads that provide finer-grained queries based on the type of registration.
  - Deprecated `instanceOnly` and `persistentOnly` arguments in favour of new `registrationTypes` arguments.
  - Prevented `renameable` and `deletable` metadata from being copied during plug promotion.
- MetadataAlgo : Added `deregisterRedundantValues()` method.

Build
-----

- Cortex : Updated to version 10.5.3.0.
