1.1.2.0
=======

Improvements
------------

- Viewer : Added support for selecting an image comparison node. This can be accessed by selecting the focus or selected node from the comparison widget at the top of the viewer, or by dragging an image node to the comparison widget.
- Catalogue :
  - Improved performance when interacting with large Catalogues.
  - Added hover state to the output index column, to indicate clickability.
  - Improved default column layout, so output index column is more compact.
- Sets : Added "Select Affected Objects" to the following plugs' right click menu :
  - Set expression and set name plugs
  - Spreadsheet cells connected to a set expression or set name plug
  - Plugs promoted from a set expression or set name plug
- PathFilter : Added "Select Affected Objects" to the following plugs' right click menu :
  - Plugs promoted from a `PathFilter.paths` plug (an unpromoted `PathFilter.paths` plug supports this since 0.61.13.0)
  - Spreadsheet cells connected to a `PathFilter.paths` plug.
  - Spreadsheet row names when the spreadsheet selector is set to `scene:path`.
- Spreadsheet : Added support for metadata on the `name` and `enabled` plug of each row. Metadata registered on plugs in the default row is mirrored automatically onto all other rows.
- ShuffleAttributes, ShufflePrimitiveVariables :
  - Added `replaceDestination` plugs that may be used to specify whether each shuffle replaces existing destination data with the same name.
  - Shuffles are now performed in the order they are defined, and separate shuffles may write to the same destination.
