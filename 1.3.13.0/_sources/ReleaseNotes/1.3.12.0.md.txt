1.3.12.0
========

Improvements
------------

- SceneReader : Added basic loding of UsdGeomNurbsCurves, converting them to CurvesPrimitives (basis curves).
- Console output : Every line is now prefixed with the message level.
- RenderPasses : Added validation of render pass names entered in the `names` plug.
- RenderPassEditor :
  - Added support for adding a new render pass to an EditScope by clicking the plus button at the bottom of the editor.
  - Added support for deleting selected render passes by clicking the minus button at the bottom of the editor, or by right-clicking one of the names and selecting 'Delete Selected Render Passes'.

Fixes
-----

- Viewer : Fixed context handling bug in the shader view ([#5654](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5654)).
- PythonCommand : Fixed misleading results for `repr( variables )` and `str( variables )`, which would suggest the dictionary was empty when it was not.
- CompoundObject : Fixed crashes in Python bindings caused by passing `None` as a key.
- Windows : Fixed "{path} was unexpected at this time." startup error when environment variables such as `PATH` contain `"` characters.
- PathListingWidget : Fixed bug which caused the pointer to be stuck displaying the "values" icon after dragging cells with no value.
- SceneAlgo : Fixed computation of history through Expression nodes.
- LightTool : Fixed crash when deleting the node being viewed.
- USD : Fixed loading of Arnold lights previously exported from Gaffer to USD.
- Catalogue : Fixed connection delays on Windows.
- Context : Fixed potential crash when setting a variable with ownership.

API

- RenderPasses : Added `registerRenderPassNameWidget()` and `createRenderPassNameWidget()` methods for registration and creation of the widget used for editing render pass names.
- RenderPassEditor : Added `addRenderPassButtonMenuSignal()` to allow customisation of the add render pass button behaviour.
