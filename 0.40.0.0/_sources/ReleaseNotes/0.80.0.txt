0.80.0
======

UI
--

- NodeGraph now only drag-selects nodes that are wholly contained in the drag area, not merely intersecting it.
- Added a Backdrop node ([#153](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/153)).

RenderMan
---------

- Added support for "help" shader annotation in RenderManShaderUI ([#536](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/536)). This provides help for the shader as a whole and is mapped into the MetaData as the node description, appearing in the NodeEditor as a tooltip.

API
---

- Added optional continuous update to string PlugValueWidgets, controlled by the continuousUpdate parameters to the constructor. This transfers the text from the ui to the plug on every keypress.

Core
----

- Fixed serialisation of dynamic BoxPlugs.

Documentation
-------------

- Improvements too numerous to mention.
