user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

in
--

The scene to be rendered.

out
---

A direct pass-through of the input scene.

state
-----

The interactive state.

updateLights
------------

When on, changes to lights are reflected in the
interactive render.

updateAttributes
----------------

When on, changes to attribute (and shaders) are reflected in the
interactive render. When working with complex scenes, it may be
worth turning this off to gain increased performance when only
editing lights.

updateCameras
-------------

When on, changes to the camera are reflected in the
interactive render.

updateCoordinateSystems
-----------------------

When on, changes to coordinate systems are reflected in the
interactive render.
