OpenImageIOReader
=================

Utility node which reads image files from disk using OpenImageIO.
All file types supported by OpenImageIO are supported by the
OpenImageIOReader.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

fileName
--------

The name of the file to be read. File sequences with
arbitrary padding may be specified using the '#' character
as a placeholder for the frame numbers. If this file sequence
format is used, then missingFrameMode will be activated.

**Supported file extensions** : b, m, p,  , c, i, n,  , d, d, s,  , d, p, x,  , f, i, t, s,  , h, d, r,  , r, g, b, e,  , i, c, o,  , i, f, f,  , z,  , j, p, g,  , j, p, e,  , j, p, e, g,  , j, i, f,  , j, f, i, f,  , j, f, i,  , e, x, r,  , s, x, r,  , m, x, r,  , p, n, g,  , p, p, m,  , p, g, m,  , p, b, m,  , p, n, m,  , p, f, m,  , p, s, d,  , p, d, d,  , p, s, b,  , r, l, a,  , s, g, i,  , r, g, b,  , r, g, b, a,  , b, w,  , i, n, t,  , i, n, t, a,  , s, o, c, k, e, t,  , p, i, c,  , t, i, f, f,  , t, i, f,  , t, x,  , e, n, v,  , s, m,  , v, s, m,  , t, g, a,  , t, p, i, c,  , z, f, i, l, e

refreshCount
------------

May be incremented to force a reload if the file has
changed on disk - otherwise old contents may still
be loaded via Gaffer's cache.

missingFrameMode
----------------

Determines how missing frames are handled when the input
fileName is a file sequence (uses the '#' character).
The default behaviour is to throw an exception, but it
can also hold the last valid frame in the sequence, or
return a black image which matches the data window and
display window of the previous valid frame in the sequence.

availableFrames
---------------

An output of the available frames for the given file sequence.
Returns an empty vector when the input fileName is not a file
sequence, even if it has a file-sequence-like structure.
