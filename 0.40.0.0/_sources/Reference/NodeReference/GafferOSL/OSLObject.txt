OSLObject
=========

Executes OSL shaders to perform object processing. Use the shaders from
the OSL/ObjectProcessing menu to read primitive variables from the input
object and then write primitive variables back to it.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

shader
------

The shader to be executed - connect the output from an OSL network here.
A minimal shader network to process P would look like this :

        InPoint->ProcessingNodes->OutPoint->OutObject

interpolation
-------------

The interpolation type of the primitive variables created by this node.
For instance, Uniform interpolation means that the shader is run once per face on a mesh, allowing it to output primitive variables with a value per face. 
All non-constant input primitive variables are resampled to match the selected interpolation so that they can be accessed from the shader.
