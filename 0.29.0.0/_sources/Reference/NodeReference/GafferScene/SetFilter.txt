SetFilter
=========

A filter which uses sets to define which locations are matched.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the filter. When it is off, the
filter does not match any locations.

out
---

The result of the filter. This should be connected into
the "filter" plug of a FilteredSceneProcessor.

set
---

The name of a set that defines the locations to
be matched.
