UVSampler
=========

Samples primitive variables from specified UV positions on
the surface of a source primitive, and transfers the
values onto new primitive variables on the sampling object.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to determine which objects in the
`in` scene will receive primitive variables sampled
from the `sourceLocation` in the `source` scene.

adjustBounds
------------

Adjusts bounding boxes to account for the changes made to the object.

> Caution : Adjusting boundings boxes has a performance penalty.
> If you do not need accurate bounds or you know that the bounds
> will only change slightly, you may prefer to turn this off.

source
------

The scene that contains the source primitive that
primitive variables will be sampled from.

sourceLocation
--------------

The location of the primitive in the `source` scene that
will be sampled from.

primitiveVariables
------------------

The names of the primitive variables to be sampled from the source
primitive. These should be separated by spaces and can use Gaffer's
standard wildcards to match multiple variables. The sampled variables
are prefixed with `prefix` before being added to the sampling object.

prefix
------

A prefix applied to the names of the sampled primitive variables before
they are added to the sampling object. This is particularly useful when
sampling something like "P", and not not wanting to modify the true
vertex positions of the sampling primitive.

status
------

The name of a boolean primitive variable created to record the success or
failure of the sampling operation.

uv
--

The primitive variable that provides the UV positions to
sample on the source primitive.
