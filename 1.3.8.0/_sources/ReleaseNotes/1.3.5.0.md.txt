1.3.5.0
=======

Features
--------

- ImageScatter : Added a new node for scattering points across an image, with density controlled by an image channel.

Improvements
------------

- Viewer : Changed the default image comparison (wipe) mode from `Over` to `Replace`.
- Spreadsheet :
  - Popups for string cells and row names are now sized to fit their column.
  - Added "Triple" and "Quadruple" width options to the spreadsheet row name popup menu.
- Node : Improved performance when casting Python-derived types to ComputeNode.

Fixes
-----

- ValuePlug : Fixed performance regression (introduced in 1.3.1.0) getting values from plugs without an input connection. This could severely affect scene generation times in some cases.
- NameSwitch : Fixed bug which prevented drag and drop reordering of rows with an input connection.
- PythonEditor :
  - Fixed output for `print()` calls with multiple arguments, which was previously spread across multiple lines.
  - Fixed bug that prevented editors being destroyed at the right time.
- FileSystemPath : Fixed bug on Windows where paths on an exFAT partition were not considered valid.

API
---

- Sampler : Added `populate()` method, which populates the internal tile cache in parallel, and subsequently allows `sample()` to be called concurrently.
