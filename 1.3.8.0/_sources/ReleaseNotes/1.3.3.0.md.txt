1.3.3.0
=======

Features
--------

- 3Delight :
  - Added support for VDB volume objects.
  - Added support for `vdbVolume` shader.
  - Added support for `volumeshader` and `displacementshader` attributes.
  - Added support for spline parameters in shaders.

Improvements
------------

- SceneReader : Added support for reading from in-memory USD stages using a filename of the form `stageCache:{id}.usd` where `{id}` specifies a stage which has been inserted in the `UsdUtilsStageCache`.
- Resample, Resize, Blur, ImageTransform : Improved performance, resulting in a 3x speedup in an obscure case, and a 5-10% speedup in more common cases.
- ImageSampler : Added `interpolate` plug to control interpolation. Previously created ImageSamplers are unaffected, but interpolation is off by default for newly created ImageSamplers.
- 3Delight :
  - Moved shaders to `3Delight/Shader` menu and removed outdated shaders from the menu.
  - Shaders (including light shaders) are only loaded from the `osl` subdirectory of the 3Delight installation.
  - Primitive variables named `uv` are now automatically renamed `st` for compatibility with the `uvCoord` shader's expectation.
  - Added a default `uvCoord` shader during internal shader network preprocessing to shader parameters that do not have an input connection.
- SetEditor : Added columns for controlling the Visible Set membership of set members. These allow the current members of a set to be included or excluded from the Visible Set by clicking within the Set Editor's Inclusions and Exclusions columns.

Fixes
-----

- SceneReader :
  - Fixed handling of invalid values on the following USD attributes :
    - PointBased : `positions`, `normals`, `velocities`, `accelerations`.
    - Curves : `widths`.
    - PointInstancer : `ids`, `protoIndices`, `orientations`, `scales`, `velocities`, `accelerations`, `angularVelocities`.
    - Points : `ids`, `widths`.
    Invalid values are now ignored with a warning, instead of loading as invalid primitive variables.
  - Fixed treatment of unconnected material outputs. If they were "authored" but not connected to a source, they were incorrectly being treated as valid attributes, and were being loaded as empty ShaderNetworks which caused problems elsewhere.
- DispatchDialogue : Changed the button label for the results display from "Ok" to "Close".
- Viewer : Fixed display of infinite values in the pixel inspectors. These were being incorrectly displayed as `nan` instead of `inf`.
- OptionTweaks : Fixed bug that prevented multiple tweaks being made to the same option in one node.

API
---

- SceneAlgo :
  - Added `findAll()` method, for finding all scene locations matching a predicate.
  - Added `findAllWithAttribute()` method, for finding all scene locations with a particular attribute.
- ThreadState : Added `process()` method.
- Process : Added const overload for `handleException()` method. The non-const version will be removed in future.
- ContextMonitor : Added `Statistics::variableHashes()` method, allowing introspection of specific variable values.

Build
-----

- MacOS : Fixed compilation with Clang 13.
- Cortex : Updated to version 10.5.2.0.
