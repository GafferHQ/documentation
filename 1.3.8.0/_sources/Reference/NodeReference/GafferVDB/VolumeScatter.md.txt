VolumeScatter
=============

Scatter points according the voxel values of a VDB grid.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

parent
------

This plug has been deprecated in favour of using a filter to select the volume.

destination
-----------

The location where the points primitives will be placed in the output scene.
When the destination is evaluated, the `${scene:path}` variable holds
the location of the source mesh, so the default value parents the points
under the mesh.

> Tip : `${scene:path}/..` may be used to place the points alongside the
> source mesh.

name
----

The name given to the PointsPrimitive -
this will be placed under the location specified by
"destination".

grid
----

Name of grid in VDBObject in which points will be scattered.

density
-------

This density is multiplied with the value of the grid to produce a number of points per unit volume.

pointType
---------

The render type of the points. This defaults to
"gl:point" so that the points are rendered in a
lightweight manner in the viewport.
