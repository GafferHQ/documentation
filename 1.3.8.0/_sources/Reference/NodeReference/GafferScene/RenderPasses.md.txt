RenderPasses
============

Appends render passes to the scene globals.

Render passes can be used to define named variations of a scene.
These can be rendered by dispatching a RenderPassWedge node downstream
of your render node of choice, or written to disk by dispatching
a RenderPassWedge node downstream of a SceneWriter.

Scenes can be varied per render pass based on the value of the
`renderPass` context variable, which will contain the name of the
current render pass being dispatched. `${renderPass}` can be used
on the `selector` plug of Spreadsheet or NameSwitch nodes to choose
specific plug values or branches of the node graph per render pass,
and its value can be queried using Expression or ContextQuery nodes.

> Tip : The list of render passes is stored in the `renderPass:names`
> option in the scene globals.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

names
-----

The names of render passes to be created.

> Tip : If any of the specified names already exist, they
> will be removed from their existing position in the list
