FilterResults
=============

Searches an input scene for all locations matched
by a filter.

> Caution : This can be an arbitrarily expensive operation
depending on the size of the input scene and the filter
used. In particular it should be noted that the usage of
`...` in a PathFilter will cause the entire input scene to
be searched even if there are no matches to be found.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

scene
-----

The scene to be searched for matching
locations.

filter
------

The filter to be used when searching for
matching locations.

out
---

The results of the search, as an `IECore::PathMatcher` object. This
is most useful for performing hierarchical queries and for iterating
through the paths without an expensive conversion to strings.

outStrings
----------

The results of the search, converted to a list of strings. This is
useful for connecting directly to other plugs, such as
`Wedge.strings` or `CollectScenes.rootNames`.
