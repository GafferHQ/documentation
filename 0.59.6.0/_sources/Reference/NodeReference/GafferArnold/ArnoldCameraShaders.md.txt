ArnoldCameraShaders
===================

Creates shaders for use with Arnold cameras. Use a ShaderAssignment
node to assign the shaders to the cameras they should affect.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

name
----

The name of the shader being represented. This should
be considered read-only. Use the Shader.loadShader()
method to load a shader.

type
----

The type of the shader being represented. This should
be considered read-only. Use the Shader.loadShader()
method to load a shader.

attributeSuffix
---------------

Suffix for the attribute used for shader assignment.

parameters
----------

Where the parameters for the shader are represented.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

filterMap
---------

A shader used to weight the samples taken by an
Arnold camera. This can be used to create vignetting effects
or to completely mask out areas of the render, causing no
rays to be fired for those pixels. The shader is evaluated
across a 0-1 UV range that is mapped to the camera's screen
space.

uvRemap
-------

A shader used to simulate lens distortion effects. The shader
is evaluated across a 0-1 UV range that is mapped to the camera's
screen space, and should output a red/green UV image of distorted
UV positions.

out
---

The output from the shader.
