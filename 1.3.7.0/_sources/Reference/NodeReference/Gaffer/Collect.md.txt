Collect
=======

Collects arbitrary input values across a range of contexts, outputting
arrays containing the values collected across that range.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

contextVariable
---------------

The context variable used to vary the values of the inputs being
collected. This should be used in the node network upstream of the
inputs.

indexContextVariable
--------------------

The context variable used to specify the index being collected. This
may be used in the node network upstream of the inputs.

contextValues
-------------

The values of the context variable. Collection will be performed once
for each context value.

enabled
-------

Enables or disables collection. This may be varied based on the
context variable, so that collection may be disabled in some
contexts but not others. Only values for enabled contexts are
included in the output arrays.

in
--

Container of inputs to be collected from. Inputs may be added by
calling `collectNode.addInput( plug )` or using the UI. Each input
provides a corresponding output parented under the `out` plug.

out
---

Container of array outputs corresponding to the inputs provided by the `in` plug.

enabledValues
-------------

Outputs an array of the context values for which collection was enabled by the `enabled` plug.
