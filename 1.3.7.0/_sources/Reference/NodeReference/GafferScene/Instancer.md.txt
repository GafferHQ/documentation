Instancer
=========

Copies from an input scene onto the vertices of a target
object, making one copy per vertex. Additional primitive
variables on the target object can be used to choose between
multiple instances, and to specify their orientation and
scale. Note the target object will be removed from the scene.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

parent
------

The object on which to make the instances. The
position, orientation and scale of the instances
are taken from per-vertex primitive variables on
this object. This is ignored when a filter is
connected, in which case the filter specifies
multiple objects to make the instances from.

name
----

The name of the location the instances will be
generated below. This will be parented directly
under the parent location.

prototypes
----------

The scene containing the prototypes to be applied to
each vertex. Use the `prototypeMode` and associated
plugs to control the mapping between prototypes and
instances.

Note that the prototypes are not limited to being a single
object - they can have arbitrary child hierarchies.

prototypeMode
-------------

The method used to define how the prototypes map
onto each instance.

- In "Indexed (Roots List)" mode, the `prototypeIndex`
  primitive variable must be an integer per-vertex.
  Optionally, a path in the prototypes scene corresponding
  to each index can be specified via the `prototypeRootsList`
  plug. If no roots are specified, an index of 0 applies the
  first location from the prototypes scene, an index of 1
  applies the second, and so on.

- In "Indexed (Roots Variable)" mode, the `prototypeIndex`
  primitive variable must be an integer per-vertex, and
  the `prototypeRoots` primitive variable must be a separate
  constant string array specifying a path in the prototypes
  scene corresponding to each index.

- In "Root per Vertex" mode, the `prototypeRoots` primitive
  variable must be a string per-vertex which will be used to
  specify a path in the prototypes scene for each instance.

  > Note : it is advisable to provide an indexed string
  array in order to limit the number of unique prototypes.

prototypeIndex
--------------

The name of a per-vertex integer primitive variable used
to determine which prototype is applied to the vertex.
This plug is used in "Indexed (Roots List)" mode as well
as "Indexed (Roots Variable)" mode.

prototypeRoots
--------------

If `prototypeMode` is set to "Indexed (Roots Variable)",
then this should specify the name of a constant string
array primitive variable used to map between `prototypeIndex`
and paths in the prototypes scene.

If `prototypeMode` is set to "Root per Vertex", then this
should specify the name of a per-vertex string primitive
variable used to specify a path in the prototypes scene
for each instance.

This plug is not used in "Indexed (Roots List)" mode.

prototypeRootsList
------------------

An explicit list of paths used to map between `prototypeIndex`
and paths in the prototypes scene. This plug is only used in
"Indexed (Roots List)" mode.

id
--

The name of a per-vertex integer primitive variable
used to give each instance a unique identity. This
is useful when points are added and removed over time,
as is often the case in a particle simulation. The
id is used to name the instance in the output scene.

omitDuplicateIds
----------------

When off, having the same ids on multiple points is considered
an error. Setting on will allow a render to proceed, with all
instances that share an id being omitted.

position
--------

The name of the per-vertex primitive variable used
to specify the position of each instance.

orientation
-----------

The name of the per-vertex primitive variable used
to specify the orientation of each instance. This
must be provided as a quaternion : use an upstream
Orientation node to convert from other representations
before instancing.

scale
-----

The name of the per-vertex primitive variable used
to specify the scale of each instance. Scale can be
provided as a float for uniform scaling, or as a vector
to define different scaling in each axis.

attributes
----------

The names of per-vertex primitive variables to be
turned into per-instance attributes. Names should
be separated by spaces and can use Gaffer's
standard wildcards.

attributePrefix
---------------

A prefix added to all per-instance attributes specified
via the "attributes" plug.

encapsulateInstanceGroups
-------------------------

Converts each group of instances into a capsule, which won't
be expanded until you Unencapsulate or render. When keeping
these locations encapsulated, downstream nodes can't see the
instance locations, which prevents editing but improves
performance. This option should be preferred to a downstream
Encapsulate node because it has the following benefits :

- Substantially improved performance when the prototypes
  define sets.
- Fewer unnecessary updates during interactive rendering.

seedEnabled
-----------

Creates a seed context variable based on a hash of the instance ID, which could come
from the primitive varable specified in the `id` plug or otherwise the point index.
This integer is available to the upstream prototypes network, and might typically
be used with a Random node to randomise properties of the prototype.

seedVariable
------------

Name of the context variable to put the seed value in.

seeds
-----

The number of possible seed values.  Increasing this allows for more different variations
to be driven by the seed, increasing the total number of variations required.

seedPermutation
---------------

Changing the seedPermutation changes the mapping of ids to seeds.  This results in a different
grouping of which instances end up with the same seed.

rawSeed
-------

Enable this in rare cases when it is required to pass through every single id directly into the seed
context variable.  This is very expensive, because every single instance will need a separate
context, but is sometimes useful, and may be an acceptable cost if there isn't a huge number of
total instances.

contextVariables
----------------

Specifies context variables to be created from primitive variables.  These variables are
available to upstream prototypes network, allowing the prototypes scene to be generated
differently depending on the source point.  Supports quantization to avoid re-evaluating the
prototypes scene too many times.

timeOffset
----------

Modify the current time when evaluating the prototypes network, by adding a primvar.

variations
----------

This special output plug returns an CompoundData dictionary with counts about how many
variations are being created.  For each context variable variable being set ( including
"frame" when using Time Offset ), there is an entry with the name of the context variable,
with an IntData containing the number of unique values of that context variable.  There is
also an entry for "", with an IntData for the total number of unique contexts, considering
all the context variables being created.

Extracting the dictionary values and displaying them to users is handled by _VariationsPlugValueWidget.

This information is important to display to users because varying the context requires
extra evaluations of the `prototypes` scene, and can dramatically increase the cost of the Instancer.

Note that variations are measured across all locations in the scene where the instancer is filtered.
