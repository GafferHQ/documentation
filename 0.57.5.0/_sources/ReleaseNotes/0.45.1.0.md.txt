0.45.1.0
========

Improvements
------------

- NodeGraph ([#2495](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2495)) :
  - Added automatic layout for auxiliary nodes.
  - Improved aesthetics of auxiliary nodes and connections.
- Viewer :
  - PointsPrimitives now default to drawing as GL points. The Drawing dropdown menu can
    be used to display them as disks instead ([#2512](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2512)).
  - Enabled anti-aliasing in the 3d view ([#2521](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2521)).
- Application : Gaffer processes are now named `gaffer ...` rather than
  `python gaffer.py ...` ([#2511](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2511)).
- Expression : Added support for `"x" in context` Python syntax ([#2513](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2513)).
- NodeEditor : Added Lock/Unlock menu items to the tool menu ([#2517](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2517)).
- Shader : Added support for showing/hiding output parameters in the NodeGraph ([#2515](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2515)).
- Arnold : Enabled procedural instancing during interactive renders. This requires a
  minimum Arnold version of 5.0.1.4 ([#2519](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2519)).

- Viewer : Fixed inaccurate picking of points and curves ([#2512](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2512)).
- Transform tools ([#2137](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2137), [#2516](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2516)) :

- NodeEditor ([#2517](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2517)) :
  - Fixed update bug which allowed plugs to be edited after an
    ancestor node was made read only.
  - Fixed bugs which allowed plugs to be added to read only nodes.
- Encapsulate : Fixed double transformation bug ([#2518](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2518)).
