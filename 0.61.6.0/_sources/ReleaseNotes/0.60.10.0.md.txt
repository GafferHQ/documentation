0.60.10.0
=========

Improvements
------------

- Backdrop : Added a dedicated title bar for selection and moving Backdrops. This is smaller but more obvious than the previous region, reducing the likelihood of accidental movement.
- NodeEditor : Added <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> shortcuts for editing source and tweak nodes respectively. These are similar to the equivalent shortcuts in the Viewer and HierarchyView, but pin an existing NodeEditor instead of creating a new one.
- Animation : Added compatibility for loading animation from Gaffer 0.61 where Step has been renamed to Constant.

Fixes
-----

- PrimitiveInspector : Fixed update when all primitive variables with a particular interpolation are removed.
