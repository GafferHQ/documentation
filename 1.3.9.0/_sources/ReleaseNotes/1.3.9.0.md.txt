1.3.9.0
=======

Improvements
------------

- 3Delight : Added support for subdivision corners and creases.
- SetEditor :
  - Added "Selection" column displaying the number of currently selected members for each set.
  - Added "Hide Empty Selection" checkbox. When on, the SetEditor will only display sets with currently selected members.

Fixes
-----

- TransformTools : Fixed editing of XYZ component plugs with individual input connections, such as when only a single component is promoted to a Box.
- AttributeQuery, OptionQuery, PrimitiveVariableQuery, ShaderQuery : Added support for querying values of all numeric data types, whereas before queries were limited to `bool`, `int` and `float` values.

API
---

- PlugAlgo : `setPlugFromData()` now supports conversions from all numeric data types to `BoolPlug`, `IntPlug` and `FloatPlug` values.
