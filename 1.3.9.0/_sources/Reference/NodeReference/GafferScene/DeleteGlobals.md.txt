DeleteGlobals
=============

A node which removes named items from the globals.
To delete outputs or options specifically, prefer
the DeleteOutputs and DeleteOptions nodes respectively,
as they provide improved interfaces for their specific
tasks.

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

The names of globals to be removed. Names should be
separated by spaces and can use Gaffer's standard wildcards.

invertNames

When on, matching names are kept, and non-matching names are removed.
