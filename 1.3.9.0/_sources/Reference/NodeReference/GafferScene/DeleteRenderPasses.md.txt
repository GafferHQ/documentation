DeleteRenderPasses
==================

Deletes render passes from the scene globals.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

mode
----

Defines how the names listed in the `names` plug
are treated. Delete mode deletes the listed names.
Keep mode keeps the listed names, deleting all others.

names
-----

The names of render passes to be deleted (or kept
if the mode is set to Keep). Names should be separated
by spaces and may contain any of Gaffer's standard
wildcards.
