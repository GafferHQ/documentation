=======

Fixes
-----

- TweakPlug : Added `Min` and `Max` tweak modes to the UI for numeric tweaks. These were previously only available through Python.
- Arnold : Fixed rendering error for cubic curves with Vertex interpolation Quatf primitive variables.
- ImageReader : Fixed reading of signed integer TIFF files, which were failing due to a missing colorspace configuration. Signed integer files are now assumed to contain linear data ([#4772](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/4772)).
