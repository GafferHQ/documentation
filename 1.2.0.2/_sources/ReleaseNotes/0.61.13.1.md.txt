0.61.13.1
=========

Fixes
-----

- SelectionTool : Fixed bug where the drawing mode overrides (Wireframe, Solid and Points) were ignored when selecting objects. This could cause a wireframe (or invisible) object to be selected instead of the visible object behind it.
- StringPlug : Fixed crashes caused by incoming connections from StringVectorDataPlugs.
- SceneViewInspector : Fixed bug where a non-existent location's parameters were being inspected. This caused `Invalid child name` errors, typically when switching focus to a node where the currently selected locations didn't exist.

API
---

- StringPlug : Deprecated `precomputedHash` argument to `getValue()` method.
