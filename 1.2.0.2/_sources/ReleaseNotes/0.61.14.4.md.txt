0.61.14.4
=========

Fixes
-----

- PathFilter : Improved positioning of PathFilters created by dropping paths onto a node.
- GraphEditor :
  - Improved handling of Backdrops when laying out nodes. Individual nodes are no longer pushed outside backdrops, and backdrops themselves are positioned as a group containing all their child nodes.
  - Improved positioning of pasted nodes, so that they are less likely to overlap with any node they are automatically connected to.
