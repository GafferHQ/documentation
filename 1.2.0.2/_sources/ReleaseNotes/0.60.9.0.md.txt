0.60.9.0
========

Improvements
------------

- Viewer : Added settings to control aperture and clipping planes when looking through lights. This can be customised on a per-light basis using the new visualiser settings on the Light node.
- Light : Added visualiser settings to control aperture and clipping planes when looking through the light in the Viewer. These settings override the defaults specified in the Viewer itself.
- LightToCamera : Added `distantAperture` and `clippingPlanes` plugs.
- Arnold Render : Changed warnings for invalid mesh lights to be one descriptive warning per light, instead of repeating an unclear warning for every surface that links to the light.

Fixes
-----

- Viewer : Framing the scene while looking through a light no longer tries to frame the light itself.
- SceneReader : Fixed bug attempting to read unsupported custom attribute types from USD files. This caused an obscure `Cannot compute hash from a CompoundObject will NULL data pointers!` error, but now prints a warning instead.
- GafferTest.TestCase :
  - Fixed `assertNodesAreDocumented()` to work for Nodes with multiple base classes.
  - Fixed `assertTypeNamesArePrefixed()` to work for Nodes in Python submodules.

API
---

- GafferTest.TestCase : Added `plugsToIgnore` argument to `assertNodesConstructWithDefaultValues()`.
- OpenGLRenderer : The `gl:queryBound` command now supports an `omitted` parameter containing a PathMatcher with paths to skip when computing the bound.
- SceneGadget : Added new `bound( selected, omitted = nullptr )` signature, which allows certain paths to be omitted from the bound computation, with or without limiting to selection. The previous `selectionBound()` method is now deprecated.
