AppleseedShaderBall
===================

Generates scenes suitable for rendering shader balls with Appleseed.

----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

---

The output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs
an empty scene.

shader
------

The shader to be rendered.

resolution
----------

The resolution of the shader ball image, which
is always a square.

environment
-----------

An environment map used for lighting. Should be in latlong
format.

maxSamples
----------

The maximum number of samples used by appleseed to render the
shader ball. A value of 0 disables the limit.

threads
-------

The number of threads used by appleseed to render the
shader ball. A value of 0 uses all cores, and negative
values reserve cores for other uses - to be used by
the rest of the UI for instance.
