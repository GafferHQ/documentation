0.24.0
======

* ParameterisedHolder now correctly loads an instance of the held class
following serialisation.

* ParameterisedHolder::setParameterised() and OpHolder::setOp() now accept
an optional keepExistingValues parameter which defaults to false. Passing
true preserves existing plug values in preference to the values in the
incoming Parameterised object.

* TabbedContainer now allows the addition of a custom Widget to the top
right corner using the setCornerWidget() and getCornerWidget() methods.

* Fixed a bug which meant that the ButtonEvent::line field was incorrectly
transformed when delivering events to Gadgets.

* Fixed tab sizing issue on OS X.

* Fixed crashes in ObjectParameterHandler triggered by plugs with null values.

* Added enterSignal(), leaveSignal(), dragEnterSignal() and dragLeaveSignal() methods to Gadget. Nodules now highlight themselves when entered using this
new functionality.

* Fixed GafferUI to work with qt 4.6 as well as 4.7.

* Gaffer can now be run embedded in Nuke.
