0.81.0
======

Core
----

- Improved dirtiness propagation mechanism to remove duplicate signal emission.

UI
--

- Backdrop improvements
	- Backdrop contents can now be scaled, so large backdrops can still have readable text when zoomed out.
	- Fixed bug which meant that empty backdrops didn't immediately redraw as highlighted when selected.
	- Improved resizing behaviour.
	- Fixed cut and paste bug.

Scene
-----

- Added doublesided attribute to StandardAttributes node ([#275](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/275)).

Arnold
------

- Fixed packaging of Arnold plugins.
- Fixed problem where light shaders weren't being created as lights.

RenderMan
---------

- Fixed public build to work with older 3delight versions where RiProceduralV isn't available.
- Added support for several new attributes in RenderManAttributes node ([#275](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/275)).

API
---

- The plugDirtiedSignal() is now emitted when a value has been edited with ValuePlug::setValue() - this means that observers need only ever use plugDirtiedSignal() instead of also having to use plugSetSignal() as well.
- Added Style::characterBound(). This returns a bounding box guaranteed to cover the largest character in the font. It is useful for correctly positioning the text baseline among other things.
