0.55.0
======

* Fixed graphical glitches caused by icons overlapping the edge of the editors on the Gnome desktop.

* SceneProcedural now renders general VisibleRenderables too.

* Fixed SceneReader to read animation at the correct speed (issue [#68](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/68)).

* File->Quit and the window close icon now prompt the user to confirm before closing if there are unsaved changes (issue [#19](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/19)).

* Added support for shader parameters of type "shader" in the RenderManShader node - these are mapped to plugs which accept connections to other RenderManShaders, allowing the creation of networks of coshaders.
