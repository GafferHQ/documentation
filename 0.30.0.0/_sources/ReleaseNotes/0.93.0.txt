0.93.0
======

#### Core

- Added the ability to specify Metadata overrides to specify instances of Plugs and Nodes.

#### UI

- Added UI Editor. This allows the user plug layout for any node to be edited - plugs can be reordered, dividers added and help strings specified. In particular this allows the creation of custom UIs for Boxes, which can then be exported and loaded by References.
- Fixed initial unsortedness of PathListingWidgets.

#### Scene

- Added PrimitiveVariables node. This allows arbitrary primitive variables with constant interpolation to be added to objects.
- Added Duplicate node. This allows arbitrary numbers of duplicates of subhierarchies to be created, each with their own transform.

#### OSL

- Specifying lockgeom=1 by default for all OSL shading engines. This means that primitive variables (user data in OSL parlance) are not automatically mapped to shader inputs unless those inputs have explicitly set lockgeom=0 in the source (which is rare). This almost doubles the speed of a simple image noising operation.
- Fixed OSLShader::acceptsInput( NULL ) crash.

#### API

- Added PlugLayout class, which creates node editor UIs driven by Metadata. This will replace all existing plug layouts over time.
- Added StringAlgo.h, containing various string utilities, including wildcard matching ([#707](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/707)).
- Added metadata accessors to OSLShader.
- Fixed module import order and namespace pollution issues.
- Replaced Metadata regexes with new string matching code.
- Added Metadata signals emitted on registration of values.
- Made NameWidget accept None for the the GraphComponent.
- Added borderWidth argument to SplitContainer constructor.
- Added PathListingWidget setHeaderVisible()/getHeaderVisible() methods.
- Added PathListingWidget.pathAt() method.
- Fixed bug in GafferUI::Pointer::setFromFile( "" )
- Added a DictPath.dict() accessor.
- Moved NodeEditor.acquire() to NodeSetEditor.acquire(). This allows it to be used to acquire an editor of any type.
- Added fallbackResult to WeakMethod.
- Fixed CompoundPlug plugSetSignal() emission when children change.
