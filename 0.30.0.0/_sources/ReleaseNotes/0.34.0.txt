0.34.0
======

* Added support for ClassVectorParameters.

* Added a -help flag to the gaffer command line.

* Fixed parameter menu bug introduced in version 0.33.2.

* Added support for TimeCodeParameters.

* Menu.popup() method now takes an optional grabFocus parameter - if this is False and a key is pressed then the menu will close and pass the key to the previous focus widget.

* PathWidget's helpful popup menus are now more helpful because they don't steal keypresses from the PathWidget itself.

* TextWidget now supports having a fixed width defined in characters using the setCharacterWidth() and getCharacterWidth() methods.

* NumericPlugValueWidget now sets maximum field width for integer plugs where max values has been set - this slightly improves the ui for the TimeCodeParameterValueWidget.
