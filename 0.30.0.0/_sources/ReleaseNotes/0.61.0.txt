0.61.0
======

* Fixed bug in MultiSelectionMenu so that if only one selection is available, it is displayed by name rather than as "All".

* Added image Sampler and Filter API classes.

* Added an image Reformat node.

* Added an ImageWriter node.

* Added RecursiveChildIterator API class.

* Fixed noodle-snatching to work with Shader nodes.

* Node Graph label now uses "/" as a separator for Box paths, rather than ".".

* Fixed layouts to allow panels to be collapsed fully and smoothly - addresses issue [#93](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/93).

* Added workaround for PyQt/PySide pyqtSignal/Signal differences.

* Fixed "CameraController not in motion" errors. These occurred when the user accidentally moved the mouse scroll wheel while performing a drag to move the camera. We now ignore wheel events when dragging the camera.

* Removed unecessary collapsible section in Group UI.

* Fixed ImageReader to work with offset data windows.

* Fixed node auto-connection to work with Shader nodes (and other nodes with nested plugs).

* Added auto-connection and auto-positioning for pasted nodes ([#13](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/13)).

* Added inherit argument to Metadata query functions ([#232](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/232)).

* Fixed negative data window origins in image module.

* Added subdivision attributes to ArnoldAttributes node.

* Renamed Assignment node to ShaderAssignment.

* Added Reference node, providing the ability to reference in external scripts to facilitate collaborative workflows ([#228](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/228)).

* Added popup plug labelling to the NodeGraph ([#138](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/138)).

* Added connection snapping to the NodeGraph - connections dragged onto a node will snap to the nearest compatible plug.

* Added ImageTransform node ([#96](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/96)).
