0.62.0
======

* Fixed bug with promotion of CompoundPlugs to Boxes.

* Fixed ImageNode paste error ([#251](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/251)).

* Fixed BoolPlugValueWidget._updateFromPlug() to avoid setting plug value ([#266](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/266)).

* Fixed bug in Group operation ([#269](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/269)).

* Implemented RenderMan shader parameter activation via annotation expressions ([#226](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/226)).
    An activator is defined by a global annotation of this form :
        pragma annotation "activator.name.expression" "pythonExpression"
    The python expression may reference current parameter values by name, and also use the connected( "parameterName" ) function to query whether or not a parameter is connected.
    Activators are then assigned to specific parameters using annotations of this form :
        pragma annotation "parameterName.activator" "name"

* Implemented annotation-based uis for RenderManLight node.

* Added a ComputeNode class, and refactored DependencyNode so it can be a useful base class for shaders as well.

* Fixed dirty propagation of Shaders through ShaderAssignments.

* Fixed 3delight workaround. GafferRenderMan now requires 3delight 10.0.138 or newer.

* Added rudimentary shader updates to InteractiveRender. Note that there are still problems whereby deadlocks sometimes occur so this isn't in a state where you'd want to bet the success of any public performances on it.

* Fixed an issue with the glBlendingMode that was causing the result to be pre-multiplied twice.

* Fixed an image rendering issue with data/display window mismatches.

* Fixed banding and dark edges evident in 2D viewer ([#74](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/74)).

* Improved speed issues when moving single nodes in the NodeGraph by refactoring GraphGadget::connectionGadgetAt ([#283](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/283)).
