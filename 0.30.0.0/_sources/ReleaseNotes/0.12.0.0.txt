0.12.0.0
========

Core
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Optimised CompoundDataPlug::hash() to ignore disabled members. This
  reduces globals hashing time by 20% for a complex production scene.
- Fixes Expression serialisation bugs ([#1081](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1081), [#1243](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1243)).
- Optimised ValuePlug hash caching. It now caches more aggressively,
  keeping cache entries alive across multiple computations. This reduces
  scene traversal time for a complex production scene by 70%.
- Improved dirty propagation mechanism.
  - Batched propagation for UndoContexts, so dirtiness is signalled
    only once for operations batched within a single undo action.
  - Fixed bugs which meant dirtiness was signalled when child/parent
    plug connections were in an inconsistent state.
  - Addition and removal of dynamic plugs now triggers dirty
    propagation.
- The values of environment variables used for string plug
  substitutions are now frozen at startup.

UI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Improved indicator for non-default plug values ([#1216](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1216)).
- Added copy/paste entries to plug menus ([#601](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/601)).
- SceneInspector now shows parameters for ExternalProcedural and
  Light objects.
- Added available set names to Set node "sets" plug popup menu.

Scene
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed PathMatcher wildcard matching bug ([#1252](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1252)).
- Added Parameters node. This can be used for tweaking the parameters
  of lights, cameras and external procedurals ([#1259](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1259)).
- Added PointsType node ([#476](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/476)).
- Fixes Seeds node to take into account the bounding box of the generated
  points.
- Fixed dirty propagation bugs in CoordinateSystem and ClippingPlane
  nodes.
- Improved InteractiveRenderer pausing during edits.
- Added DeleteSets node.
- Fixed CustomOptions dirty propagation ([#1039](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1039)).
- Fixed ContextVariables dirty propagation.
- Optimised Filter mechanism, giving a 7-20% improvement in performance
  across a range of production scenes.

Appleseed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added support for interactive renderering with shader and light
  edits.

Image
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added support for image metadata
  - ImagePlug has a new metadata child plug.
  - ImageReader reads metadata from file.
  - ImageWriter writes metadata to file.
  - ImagePrimitiveSource loads metadata from `ImagePrimitive::blindData()`.
  - Merge copies metadata from the first input.
  - ImageMetadata node creates/sets metadata.
  - DeleteImageMetadata node removed metadata.
  - CopyImageMetadata transfers metadata from one image to another.
- Optimised many nodes with direct internal pass-though connections.

API
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- StringAlgo
  - Added `hasWildcards()` function.
  - Removed flawed MatchPatternLess ([#1252](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1252)).
- NodeAlgo
  - Added `isSetToUserDefault( plug )` function.
- RendererAlgo
  - Added `outputAttributes()` method.
- ImageNode
  - `hash*()` and `compute*()` methods are no longer pure virtual.
    This allows subclasses to make direct internal connections to
    pass through input plugs unchanged.
- PlugValueWidget
  - Replaced `_dropValue()` method with `_convertValue()`.
- Menu
  - Added support for `functools.partial( WeakMethod )`
    in menu commands.
- Simplified and improved Merge node implementation.
- Added MetadataProcessor base class to GafferImage.
- Added Plug::dirty() virtual method. This is used to inform a Plug
  that it has been dirtied by Plug::propagateDirtiness().
- Fixed DependencyNodeWrapper to translate python exceptions to C++.

Build
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed compilation without NDEBUG=1 with gcc 4.1.2.

 Incompatibilities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Removed MatchPatternLess from StringAlgo.h.
- Replaced PlugValueWidget `_dropValue()` method with `_convertValue()`.
- Removed GafferImage::FilterProcessor.
- Added/removed virtual overrides in GafferImage.
- Added virtual function to Plug.
