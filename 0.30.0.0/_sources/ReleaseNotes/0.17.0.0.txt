0.17.0.0
========

This release brings several major features in addition to the usual
enhancements and bug fixes. Of particular interest are the addition
of a basic keyframing system, support for using OSL expressions
alongside the existing Python expressions, and several new image
processing nodes exposing OpenColorIO functionality.

Core
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added Animation node, providing basic support for keyframed animation.
- Added frames-per-second support to Contexts, to map between frames
  and a time in seconds.
- Expression
  - Fixed bug when identical expressions acted on different plug types.
  - Added support for calling `context.getTime()`.
  - Added support for calling `context.getFramesPerSecond()`.
  - Fixed bugs when a plug or node is renamed.
  - Fixed bugs when manually disconnecting an output or input
    of an expression.
  - Improved error reporting in the UI.
- Fixed InputGenerator backwards compatibility bug introduced in
  0.16.0.0.
- Box
  - Promoting a plug now properly copies plug metadata ([#1468](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1468)).
- Plug
  - Fixed rare crash during dirty propagation.
  - Fixed bug in child connection tracking behaviour.

UI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- NodeEditor
  - Plug context menus
    - Added keyframing menu items for numeric and bool plugs.
    - Added Lock/Unlock meu items.
    - Added menu item for creating an OSL expression.
  - Tool menu
    - Added "Revert to Defaults" menu item.
- NodeGraph
  - Added right click menu items for reordering plugs on Boxes.
  - Fixed bugs triggered by the dynamic hiding and showing of plugs
    via the UIEditor.
- Dot
  - Added optional labels. These can be derived from the
    dot node name or the upstream node name or may be
    specified directly.
- Shader loading dialogues
  - Added bookmarks.
- Viewer
  - Fixed bug which could mean the camera would move unexpectedly
    even when look-through mode is not enabled.
  - Fixed OpenColorIO configs.
- UIEditor
  - Fixed renaming of empty user sections.
  - Prevented renaming of section to invalid names like "".
  - Added default Settings section.
  - Fixed presets UI to update values when the selected preset
    changes.
  - Ignores user plugs on box nodes.
- Box
  - Added default Settings section.
  - Disabled plug addition button in User section.
- Fixed bug which could cause the display of corrupted icons.
- ShaderSwitch
  - Fixed UI to provide access to each input rather than just the
    array input as a whole ([#1461](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1461)).
- Numeric fields
  - Ensured that keyboard-nudged numbers have an extra 0 added as
    necessary to ensure that the same digit is always being modified.

Image
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- New OpenColorIO nodes
  - LUT
  - CDL
  - DisplayTransform
- ImageWriter
  - Added file format options.
  - Made sure OIIO queries for nchannel and alpha support are
    respected.
- Merge
  - Fixed artifacts when the data windows differ between layers.
  - Fixed crash.
- Resize
  - Fixed artifacts when upsizing with the sinc filter ([#1457](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1457)).
- Changed convention for image bounding boxes to specify that the
  maximum coordinates are exclusive (outside the box).
- Fixed Crop UI for images with the default format.
- Resample
  - Fixed incorrect input sample region.

Scene
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed loading of UnionFilters from Gaffer 0.15.0.0 ([#1474](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1474)).
- Fixed loading of FilterSwitches from Gaffer 0.15.0.0 ([#1474](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1474)).
- Attributes are now output to the renderer before shaders at the
  same location. This works around a bug in 3delight's shader
  construction.
- Fixed crash when loading sets from an empty SceneReader.
- Added support for frames-per-second to SceneReader, AlembicSource
  and SceneWriter.

OSL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added support for using OSL as a general purpose expression language.

Cortex
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed issue where non-ValuePlugs were not syncing during setPlugValue().
- Fixed OpHolder node summaries.

API
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Expression
  - Redesigned API to better support multiple languages.
- Context
  - Added "framesPerSecond" variable and time accessors.
- Metadata
  - Added nodesWithMetadata() and plugsWithMetadata() methods.
- StandardNodeGadget
  - Removed orientation constructor parameter. Use metadata instead.
  - Added dynamic nodule reordering controlled by metadata.
- ScriptNode
  - Fixed undo merging for CompoundNumericPlugs ([#422](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/422)).
- Plug
  - Made setFlags() undoable.
- PlugLayout
  - Ignore custom widgets with type "". This allows a widget
    inherited from a base class to be removed by a derived class
    or instance metadata.
- Removed UserPlugValueWidget.
- Added UserPlug namespace.
- Deprecated use of arbitrary Widget constructor keyword arguments
  for auto-parenting. The `parenting` argument should be used instead.
- Image
  - Renamed GafferImage::OpenColorIO to ColorSpace.
  - Changed convention for image bounding boxes to specify that the
    maximum coordinates are exclusive (outside the box).
    - Added image window utility methods to assist with this change.
  - Added OpenColorIOTransform abstract base class. This makes it
    easy to implement nodes whose processing is performed via OpenColorIO.
  - Sampler
    - Remove sample window accessors.
    - Deprecated constructor taking a filter.
- Added NumericWidget.valueToString() method.

Incompatibilities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Redesigned expression API to better support multiple languages.
- Changed convention for image bounding boxes to specify that the
  maximum coordinates are exclusive (outside the box).
- NodeGadget
  - Added noduleAddedSignal() and noduleRemovedSignal().
- StandardNodeGadget
  - Removed orientation constructor parameter. Use metadata instead.
- GraphComponentWrapper
  - Improved constructors to allow any type to be passed to the single
    argument constructor.
- Removed UserPlugValueWidget.
- Deprecated use of arbitrary Widget constructor keyword arguments
  for auto-parenting. The `parenting` argument should be used instead.
- Renamed GafferImage::OpenColorIO to ColorSpace.
- Sampler
  - Remove sample window accessors.
  - Deprecated constructor taking a filter.
