0.57.0
======

* Renamed ColorPlug child names to rgba rather than xyzw (issue [#133](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/133)).

* File->SaveAs... menu item now adds the file to the recent files list.

* Fixed unwanted vertical expansion of color plug widgets.

* Removed the unwanted visualisation of the "name" plug on shaders in the Node Graph.

* Added NodeGraph plugContextMenuSignal() and connectionContextMenuSignal() to allow customisable right click menus for plugs and connections (issue [#122](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/122)).

* RenderManShader annotations are now correctly reloaded when the shader itself is reloaded.

* RenderManShader UI produces more sensible errors when bad annotations are discovered.

* Fixed parameter ordering in RenderManShader UI (issue [#136](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/136)).

* Fixed bug which prevented numeric plug entry fields from showing the correct value when values outside the allowable range were entered.
