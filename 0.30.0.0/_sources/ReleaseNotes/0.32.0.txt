0.32.0
======

* Added GafferUI.NotificationMessageHandler, for displaying IECore messages in a little window.

* Added a ParameterHandler and ParameterValueWidget for DateTimeParameters.

* VectorDataWidget size behaviour now works much better for large amounts of data. It is now possible to use the browser's FileIndexedIO preview tab to view large amounts of data
from .cob and .fio files.

* Fixed bug in VectorDataWidget, whereby the vertical header would disappear when rows were deleted.

* Multiple fields may now be edited simultaneously in the VectorDataWidget, by selecting several fields before editing one of the selected fields. Changes are automatically copied to the rest of the selection. Columns may be selected by clicking on the horizontal header
and rows by clicking on the vertical header.

* The enter and return keys can now be used to edit the checkbox fields of a VectorDataWidget.

* The MultiLineTextWidget now has setEditable, getEditable, textChangedSignal, editingFinishedSignal and activatedSignal methods equivalent to the existing methods on TextWidget.

* Added a MultiLineStringPlugValueWidget class.

* StringParameterValueWidget now supports the ["UI"]["multiLine"] user data item.

* The browser app now has an "initialPath" parameter to allows the browsing location to be set from the command line.

* Added Gaffer.AttributeCachePath and GafferUI.AttributeCachePathPreview classes, to allow browsing of attribute caches.

* Browsing for paths from a PathPlugValueWidget where the path is presumed empty now starts from the current working directory.
