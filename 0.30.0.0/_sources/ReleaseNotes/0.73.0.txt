0.73.0
======

- Implemented connection hiding for the NodeGraph. This is accessed by right clicking on a node in the Node Graph and using the new "Show Input Connections" and "Show Output Connections" menu items ([#429](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/429)).
- Fixed const correctness of GraphGadget::getNodePosition().
- Fixed connection drag bug. Dragging the endpoint of a connection around and then placing it back where it started was breaking the connection, whereas it should have been having no effect.
- Replaced Enabled/Disable node menu item with Enabled checkbox.
- Added titles to the node graph context menus.
