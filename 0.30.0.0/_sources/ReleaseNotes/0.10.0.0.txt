0.10.0.0
========

Core
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Reimplemented paths framework in C++ ([#1190](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1190)). This gives much
  improved performance - 10x or more speed improvements in the
  SceneHierarchy panel.
- Fixed subprocess hangs seen when dispatching renders inside Maya.
- Restored compatibility with references from prior to version 0.8.0.0.

UI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added bookmarks system for NodeGraph ([#849](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/849)).
  - Bookmark nodes using the right-click node context menu
  - Connect plugs to bookmarked nodes using the right-click plug
    context menu.
- Added NodeGraph Ctrl+Click to select all downstream nodes ([#941](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/941)).
- Added additional "Edit/Select Connected" menu items
- Fixed "Edit/SelectConnected" menu items to ignore invisible nodes.
- Fixed "Edit/SelectAll" menu item to ignore invisible nodes ([#1207](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1207)).
- Highlighted plugs at non-default values in the NodeEditor ([#1216](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1216)).
- SceneInspector
  - Significant performance improvements.
  - Added name based filtering for options and attributes ([#1159](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1159)).
  - Added query caching.
- Fixed bug whereby Widget.setVisible( notABool ) could cause problems.
- Fixed clearing of StandardNodeGadget errors for non-DependencyNodes.

Scene
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added "mode" plug to Set node. This allows paths to be added to or
  removed from existing sets, in addition to the old behaviour of
  creating a new set (or replacing an existing one of the same name).
- Added ClippingPlane node.
- Added "enabled" plug to Filter nodes ([#1196](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1196)).
- Added FilterSwitch node ([#1197](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1197)).
- Added "name" plug to Duplicate node, to provide control over the
  names given to the duplicates ([#1200](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1200)).

Appleseed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added photon target attribute.
- Added sampler option.
- Synced default options with new Appleseed defaults.

Cortex
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added UI hint to control the visibility of the header in the
  ParameterisedHolder node UI.

API
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- GraphGadget
  - Added degreesOfSeparation argument to upstreamNodeGadgets() method.
  - Added downstreamNodeGadgets() and connectedNodeGadgets() methods.
- EditMenu
  - Added scope() method. This should be used by custom edit menu
    commands to ensure they operate on the right portion of the
    node graph.
- CompoundVectorParameterValueWidget
  - Added support for "showIndices" parameter user data.
- PathMatcher
  - Added addPaths() and removePaths() methods, each taking a second
    PathMatcher to provide the paths.
- Serialisation
  - Made classPath() and modulePath() methods compatible with passing
    a class as well as an instance.
- PathListingWidget
  - Added setSortable() and getSortable() methods.
- Added MatchPatternPathFilter
- Added bindings for SceneAlgo camera() and shutter() functions.
- Metadata
  - Added control over persistence of instance values.
- Added preprocessor macros for gaffer version numbers.

Incompatibilities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Path
  - The info API has been replaced with a property API. Emulation
    for the old API exists, but it has been deprecated.
  - Properties must derive from RunTimeTyped, whereas info could
    contain any python type.
  - Subclasses now _must_ implement the copy() method.
- PathListingWidget
  - Column python class has been replaced with several specialised
    C++ subclasses. It is no longer possible to derive from Column
    in python.
- GraphGadget
  - Added argument to upstreamNodeGadgets() method.
- GafferScene::Filter
  - Renamed "match" plug to "out". Backwards compatibility is
    provided by a __getattr__ alias in Python.

Build
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Updated public build to use Cortex 9.0.0-b4.
- libGafferUI now links with Qt. This must be considered when building
  Gaffer to be hosted inside other applications.
- Requires subprocess32 python module.
- Added subprocess32 to dependencies build process.
