0.10.0
======

* Fixed flickering in the Viewer - enabled double buffering in same way as GraphEditor.

* The view application has been ported from gtk to Qt.

* The Collapsible widget no longer changes width when its collapse state is changed.

* Window.addChildWindow() has been ported from gtk to Qt. This means that dialogues can be made to stay on top of the windows that launch them.

* GafferUI.Dialogue.__init__ now accepts borderWidth and resizeable arguments.

* Collapsible constructor now accepts borderWidth argument.

* MultiLineTextWidget now accepts text argument to constructor.

* OpDialogue now reliably closes itself following execution or cancel. A future version may stay open if userData on the Op requests it.

* All signal connections are now made to Gaffer.WeakMethod objects where appropriate. Updated the Widget documentation to encourage the use of WeakMethod.

* GafferUI.Frame class now accepts a child argument to the constructor, actually uses the borderWidth argument, and Frame.setChild( None ) no longer errors.

* Rationalised Window close behaviour. Added Window.close() method which may be called to request that a window be closed - this is also called when the user clicks the close icon. Window subclasses may override Window._acceptsClose to reject or defer closing. Window.closeSignal() has been renamed to Window.closedSignal() and now is now used purely for notification when a window has closed (the return value from attached slots is irrelevant).

* GafferUI.Frame has a borderStyle argument, defaulting to drawing a rather plain border.

* OpDialogue now reports errors using a new ErrorDialogue class.

* GafferUI.CamelCase has been removed as it was ported into IECore some time ago.

* Fixed bug which prevented GraphComponent::commonAncestor<T>() from compiling.

* Gadgets and Widgets may now have tooltips. Client code can set the tooltip using setToolTip(), and classes may provide default dynamic values by implementing getToolTip() appropriately. Currently the NodeGadget, Nodule and ConnectionGadget implement getToolTip to return information about the Nodes, Plugs and Connections they represent.

* Widgets now have a wheelSignal() for responding to mouse wheel events. The Viewer and GraphEditor use this to implement zooming.

* Fixed bug which prevented Collapsible containers from toggling state correctly when multiple instances shared a parent.

* Node UIs now use a ScrolledContainer for their top level container.

* Label widget now allows the alignment to be specified.

* Fixed alignment issues in NodeUIs.

* OpDialogue has a better default size.

* Added handlers for the following parameter types :

	IECore.V2iParameter
	IECore.V3iParameter
	IECore.V2fParameter
	IECore.V3fParameter
	IECore.Color3fParameter
	IECore.Color4fParameter

* Fixed TypeError: invalid argument to sipBadCatcherResult() messages coming from ColorSwatch widget.
