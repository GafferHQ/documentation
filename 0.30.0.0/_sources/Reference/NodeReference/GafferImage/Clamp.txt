Clamp
=====

Clamps channel values so that they fit within a specified
range. Clamping is performed for each channel individually,
and out-of-range colours may be highlighted by setting them
to a value different to the clamp threshold itself.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image

channels
--------

The subset of channels to operate on.

min
---

The minimum value - values below this will
be clamped if minEnabled is on.

max
---

The maximum value - values above this will
be clamped if maxEnabled is on.

minClampTo
----------

By default, values below the minimum value are
clamped to the minimum value itself. If minClampToEnabled
is on, they are instead set to this value. This can
be useful for highlighting out-of-range values.

maxClampTo
----------

By default, values above the maximum value are
clamped to the maximum value itself. If maxClampToEnabled
is on, they are instead set to this value. This can
be useful for highlighting out-of-range values.

minEnabled
----------

Turns on clamping for values below the min value.

maxEnabled
----------

Turns on clamping for values above the max value.

minClampToEnabled
-----------------

Turns on the effect of minClampTo, allowing out
of range values to be highlighted.

maxClampToEnabled
-----------------

Turns on the effect of maxClampTo, allowing out
of range values to be highlighted.
