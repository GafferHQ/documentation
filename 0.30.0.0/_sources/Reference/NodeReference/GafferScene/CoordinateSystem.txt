CoordinateSystem
================

Produces scenes containing a coordinate system. Coordinate systems
have two main uses :

- To visualise the transform at a particular location. In this
  respect they're similar to locators or nulls in other packages.
- To define a named coordinate system to be used in shaders at
  render time. This is useful for defining projections or procedural
  solid textures. The full path to the location of the coordinate
  system should be used to refer to it within shaders.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs
an empty scene.

name
----

The name of the object in the output scene.

sets
----

A list of sets to include the object in. The
names should be separated by spaces.

transform
---------

The transform applied to the object.
