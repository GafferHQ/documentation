Transform
=========

Applies a transformation to the local matrix
of all locations matched by the filter.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

space
-----

The space in which the transformation is specified.
Note that no matter which space is chosen, only the
local matrices of the filtered locations are ever modified.
They are simply modified in such as way as to emulate a
modification in the chosen space.

Local
:       The transformation is specified in local space and
        is therefore post-multiplied onto the local matrix.

Parent
:       The transformation is specified in parent space and
        is therefore pre-multiplied onto the local matrix.

World
:       The transformation is specified in world space and
        will therefore be applied as if the whole world was
        moved. This effect is then applied on a per-location
        basis to each of the filtered locations.

Reset Local
:       The local matrix is replaced with the specified transform.

Reset World
:       The transformation is specified as an absolute matrix
        in world space. Each of the filtered locations will
        be moved to this absolute position.
