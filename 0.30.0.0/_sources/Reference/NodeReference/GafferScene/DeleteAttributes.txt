DeleteAttributes
================

Deletes attributes from locations within the scene.
Those locations will then inherit the attribute
values from ancestor locations instead, or will fall
back to using the default attribute value.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

names
-----

The names of attributes to be removed. Names should be
separated by spaces and can use Gaffer's standard wildcards.

invertNames
-----------

When on, matching names are kept, and non-matching names are removed.
