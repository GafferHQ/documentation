0.58.0
======

* Fixed creation of nodes within Boxes - previously they were added below the root of the script rather than inside the box.

* Fixed unstable scene hierarchy expansion (issue [#120](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/120)).

* Fixed highlighting bugs whereby widgets inside a highlighted tab would incorrectly display an inherited highlight state. This could be seen when dragging a node into the node editor with either nested tabs or a nested VectorDataWidget.

* Fixed PathPlugValueWidget bug where it would attempt to change the value of a read only plug.

* Fixed PathWidget bug where it would still do autocompletion and popup menus even when non-editable.

* Added TabbedContainer.insert() method.

* Generalised the Metadata system to store arbitrary values rather than just descriptions.

* Fixed CompoundPlugValueWidget bug whereby it would error if a summary was provided on a non-collapsible UI.

* Added right-click context menus to enum and checkbox plug uis.

* Added Box plug-promotion feature ([#142](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/142)).

* Removed Gaffer.GroupNode ([#164](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/164)).

* Fixed ordering of parameters in RenderManShader UI ([#136](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/136)).

* Fixed banding and dark edges evident in 2D viewer ([#74](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/74)).

* Fixed awkward zooming of Viewers and NodeGraph ([#46](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/46)).
