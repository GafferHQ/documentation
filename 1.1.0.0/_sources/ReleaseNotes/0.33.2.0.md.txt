0.33.2.0
========

Features
--------

- Added Image Catalogue node ([#2077](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2077))
  - Key features include:
      - Loading, exporting, removing, and renaming images on disk.
      - Receiving renders from an InteractiveRender node, automatically combining
        multiple AOVs into a single image stream.
      - Snapshot (copying) images, including in-progress renders.
      - Adding notes to images.
      - Drag 'n' drop of any other image node into the image list to snapshot it
        and add it to the catalogue.

Improvements
------------

- OSL ShadingEngine : Added 'shading:index' special attr to getattribute ([#2067](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/2067))
  - This can be used to fetch the index of the current shading point.
