RandomChoice
============

Chooses random values from a list of choices, with optional weights
to specify the relative probability of each choice.

The randomness is generated from a seed and a context
variable; to get useful variation either the seed or the
value of the context variable must be varied too.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

seed
----

Seed for the random number generator. Different seeds
produce different random numbers. When controlling two
different properties using the same context variable,
different seeds may be used to ensure that the generated
values are different.

seedVariable
------------

The most important plug for achieving interesting variation.
Should be set to the name of a context variable which will
be different for each evaluation of the node. Good examples
are `scene:path` to generate a different value per scene
location, or `frame` to generate a different value per frame.

choices
-------

The choices that will be randomly selected between based on the seed.

choices.weights
---------------

The list of weights for the choices. Choices with a higher weight
have a greater chance of being chosen.
