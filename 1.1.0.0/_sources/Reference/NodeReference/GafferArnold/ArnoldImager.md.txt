ArnoldImager
============

Assigns an imager. This is stored as an `ai:imager` option in Gaffer's
globals, and applied to all render outputs.

> Tip : Use the `layer_selection` parameter on each imager to control
> which AOVs the imager applies to.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

imager
------

The imager to be assigned. The output of an ArnoldShader node
holding an imager should be connected here. Multiple imagers may be
assigned at once by chaining them together via their `input`
parameters, and then assigning the final imager via the ArnoldImager
node.

mode
----

The mode used to combine the `imager` input with any imagers that
already exist in the globals.

- Replace : Removes all pre-existing imagers, and replaces them with
  the new ones.
- InsertFirst : Inserts the new imagers so that they will be run before
  any pre-existing imagers.
- InsertLast : Inserts the new imagers so that they will be run after
  any pre-existing imagers.
