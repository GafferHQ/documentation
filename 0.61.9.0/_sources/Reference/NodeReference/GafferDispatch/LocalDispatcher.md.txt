LocalDispatcher
===============

Schedules execution of task graphs on the local machine. Tasks
may be dispatched in the background to keep the UI responsive.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

framesMode
----------

Determines the active frame range to be dispatched as
follows :

  - CurrentFrame uses the current timeline frame only.
  - FullRange uses the outer handles of the timeline
    (i.e. the full range of the script).
  - CustomRange uses a user defined range, as specified by
    the frameRange plug.

frameRange
----------

The frame range to be used when framesMode is "CustomRange".

jobName
-------

A descriptive name for the job.

jobsDirectory
-------------

A directory to store temporary files used by the dispatcher.

executeInBackground
-------------------

Executes the dispatched tasks in separate processes via a
background thread.

ignoreScriptLoadErrors
----------------------

Ignores errors loading the script when executing in the background.
This is not recommended - fix the problem instead.

environmentCommand
------------------

Optional system command to modify the environment when launching
tasks in the background. Background tasks are launched in a separate
process using a `gaffer execute ...` command, and they inherit the
environment from the launching process. When an environment
command is specified, tasks are instead launched using `environmentCommand
gaffer execute ...`, and the environment command is responsible for
modifying the inherited environment and then launching `gaffer execute ...`.

For example, the following environment command will use the standard `/usr/bin/env`
program to set some custom variables :

```
/usr/bin/env FOO=BAR TOTO=TATA
```
