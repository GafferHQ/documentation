PrimitiveVariables
==================

Adds arbitrary primitive variables to objects. Currently only primitive
variables with constant interpolation are supported - see the OSLObject
node for a means of creating variables with vertex interpolation.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

primitiveVariables
------------------

The primitive variables to be applied - arbitrary numbers of user
defined primitive variables may be added as children of this plug
via the user interface, or using the CompoundDataPlug API via
python.
