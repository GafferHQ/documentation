0.2.0.0
=======

This release brings significant optimisations, further additions to the SceneInspector, and the usual collection of miscellaneous enhancements and bug fixes.

#### Core

- Optimised Context::substitute(). This gives a 73% reduction in runtime for a substitutions benchmark.
- Added '\' as an escape character in Context::substitute() ([#997](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/997)).
- Boxes may now be enabled/disabled and define pass-through behaviours ([#1015](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/1015)).
- Significant optimisations to the computation engine.
- Added TaskList node for grouping the dispatch of several input requirements.

#### Image

- Fixed Display node for bucket sizes larger than the native tile size.
- Fixed problems when running embedded in Maya.

#### Scene

- Added code to clear caches after full procedural expansion in batch renders.
- Added scene pass-through to the InteractiveRender node. This allows it to be seen in the Viewer, SceneHierarchy, SceneInspector etc.
- Significant optimisations. A benchmark scene can now be generated in 3% of its previous runtime.
