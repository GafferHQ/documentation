Grade
=====

Performs a simple per-channel colour grading operation
as follows :

A = multiply * (gain - lift) / (whitePoint - blackPoint)
B = offset + lift - A * blackPoint
result = pow( A * input + B, 1/gamma )

See the descriptions for individual plug for a slightly
more practical explanation of the formula.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image

channels
--------

The names of the channels to operate on. Names should be
separated by spaces and can use Gaffer's standard
wildcards.

blackPoint
----------

The input colour which is considered to be
"black". This colour is remapped to the
lift value in the output image.

whitePoint
----------

The input colour which is considered to be
"white". This colour is remapped to the
gain value in the output image.

lift
----

The colour that input pixels at the blackPoint
become in the output image. This can be thought
of as lifting the darker values of the image.

gain
----

The colour that input pixels at the whitePoint
become in the output image. This can be thought
of as defining the lighter values of the image.

multiply
--------

An additional multiplier on the output values.

offset
------

An additional offset added to the output values.

gamma
-----

A gamma correction applied after all the remapping
defined above.

blackClamp
----------

Clamps input values so they don't go below 0.

whiteClamp
----------

Clamps output values so they don't go above 1.
