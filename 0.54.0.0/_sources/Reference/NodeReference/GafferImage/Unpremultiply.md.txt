Unpremultiply
=============

Divides selected channels by a specified alpha channel.
If the alpha channel on a pixel is 0, then that pixel will remain
the same as the input.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image

channels
--------

The names of the channels to operate on. Names should be
separated by spaces and can use Gaffer's standard
wildcards.

alphaChannel
------------

The channel to use as the alpha channel.
The selected channel does not have to be 'A', but whichever
channel is chosen will act as the alpha for the sake of this
node.
This channel will never be divided by itself - it will
remain the same as the input.
