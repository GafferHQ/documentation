ScriptNode
==========

Defines a "script" - a Gaffer node network which can be
saved to disk as a ".gfr" file and reloaded.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

fileName
--------

Where the script is stored.

unsavedChanges
--------------

Indicates whether or not the script has been
modified since it was last saved.

frameRange
----------

Defines the start and end frames for the script.
These don't enforce anything, but are typically
used by dispatchers to control default frame
ranges, and by the UI to define the range of the
time slider.

frameRange.start
----------------

The start frame. This doesn't enforce anything,
but is typically used by dispatchers to control
default frame ranges, and by the UI to define
the range of the time slider.

frameRange.end
--------------

The end frame. This doesn't enforce anything,
but is typically used by dispatchers to control
default frame ranges, and by the UI to define
the range of the time slider.

frame
-----

The current frame.

> Note : To perform a computation at a particular time,
> you should create your own context rather than change
> the value of this plug.
>
> ```
> with Gaffer.Context( script.context() ) as c :
>       c.setFrame( f )
>   ...
> ```
>
> Likewise, you should never refer to this plug from
> an expression. Always retrieve the frame with
> `context.getFrame()` instead.

framesPerSecond
---------------

The framerate used to convert between the current
frame number and the time in seconds.

variables
---------

Container for user-defined variables which can
be used in expressions anywhere in the script.
