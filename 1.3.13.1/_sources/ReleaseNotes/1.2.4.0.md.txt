1.2.4.0
=======

Features
--------

- FramingConstraint : Added a new node for moving cameras to frame a chosen target.

Improvements
------------

- CollectImages : Added `mergeMetadata` plug. This allows the metadata from all collected images to be merged, whereas before only the metadata from the first image was passed through.
- SpreadsheetUI : Added the ability to filter the rows displayed in a spreadsheet's UI ([#5092](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5092)).

Fixes
-----

- Arnold : Moved `distance` shader to the `Shader/Utility` section of the node menu (previously in `Shader/Other`).
- Graph Editor : Fixed a bug for some video drivers that led to a crash when using nodes with icons.
- Node Editor : Removed `Gang/Ungang` menu options from output plugs.
- SpreadsheetUI : Fixed bug which prevented the addition of new rows and columns when an existing plug had an input connection ([#5248](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/5248)).
- VectorDataWidget : Fixed bugs preventing the display of headers and values for matrix and box data.
