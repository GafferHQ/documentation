PrimitiveVariableQuery
======================

Queries primitive variables at a scene location, creating an output for
each primitive variable.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

scene
-----

The scene to query the primitive variable from.

location
--------

The location within the scene to query the primitive variable at.
> Note : If the location does not exist then the query will not be
> performed and all outputs will be set to their default values.

queries
-------

The primitive variables to be queried - arbitrary numbers of primitive
variables may be added as children of this plug via the user interface,
or via python. Each child is a `NameValuePlug` whose `name` plug is the
name of the primitive variable to query, and whose `value` plug is the
default value to use if the primitive variable can not be retrieved.

out
---

The parent plug of the query outputs. The order of outputs corresponds
to the order of children of `queries`.
