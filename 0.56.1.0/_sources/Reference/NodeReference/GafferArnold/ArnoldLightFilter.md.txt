LightFilter that can be positioned in space to filter light in a particular
region. Note that this is a non-physical effect. LightFilters need to get
linked to lights which you can do via a StandardAttributes node.

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out

The output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs
an empty scene.

name
----

The name of the object in the output scene.

sets
----

A list of sets to include the object in. The
names should be separated by spaces.

transform
---------

The lights that are being filtered. Accepts a SetExpression. You
might want to set it to 'defaultLights' to have the filter affect
all lights that haven't been excluded from that set.

parameters

The parameters of the light filter shader - these will vary based on the type.
