OSLImage
========

Executes OSL shaders to perform image processing. Use the shaders from
the OSL/ImageProcessing menu to read values from the input image and
then write values back to it.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image

defaultFormat
-------------

The resolution and aspect ratio to output when there is no input image provided.

channels
--------

Define image channels to output by adding child plugs and connecting
corresponding OSL shaders.  You can drive RGB layers with a color,
or connect individual channels to a float.

If you want to add multiple channels at once, you can also add a closure plug,
which can accept a connection from an OSLCode with a combined output closure.
