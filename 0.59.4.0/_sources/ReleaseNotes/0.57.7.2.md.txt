0.57.7.2
========

- PrimitiveInspector :
  - Fixed bug that caused data lists to lose their scroll position during updates.
  - Fixed bug that could cause the inspector to show a different location to other Editors.
  - Fixed bug when the selected location doesn't exist in the input scene.
- Attributes : Fixed bug that could prevent interactive updates when the `global` plug was on.
- CollectScenes : Fixed childNames hashing bug.
- SceneWriter : Fixed error caused by computed filenames with a dependency on time. This
  makes it possible to write to a sequence of cache files rather than one monolithic file.
- GafferArnold : Added missing GafferOSL Python bindings import.
