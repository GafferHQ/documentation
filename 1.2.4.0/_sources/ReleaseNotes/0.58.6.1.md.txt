Fixes
-----

- Viewer :
  - Fixed bug that caused the Inspector to edit the wrong node when SetFilters were in use.
  - Fixed bugs when using the CameraTool to manipulate scaled cameras or lights. Note: the Viewport projection will no longer display the effects of scale or shear components in the view matrix.
- Render/InteractiveRender : Fixed bug in light filter context handling. This could result in light filters not being linked to the correct lights, or cause exceptions during scene translation.

API
---

- FilterPlug : Added `match` method to evaluate the filter for the specified `ScenePlug`.
- ViewportGadget : `setCameraTransform` now properly removes scale and shear from the supplied matrix.
