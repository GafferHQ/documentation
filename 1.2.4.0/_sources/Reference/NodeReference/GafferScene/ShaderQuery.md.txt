ShaderQuery
===========

Queries shader parameters from a scene location, creating outputs
for each parameter.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

scene
-----

The scene to query the shader for.

location
--------

The location within the scene to query the shader at.
> Note : If the location does not exist then the query will not be
> performed and all outputs will be set to their default values.

shader
------

The name of the shader to query.
> Note : If the shader does not exist then the query will not be
> performed and all outputs will be set to their default values.

inherit
-------

Queries inherited shader assignments if the location has no local
assignment of its own.

queries
-------

The shader parameters to be queried - arbitrary numbers of shader
parameters may be added as children of this plug via the user interface,
or via python. Each child is a `NameValuePlug` whose `name` plug is
the shader parameter to query, and whose `value` plug is the default
value to use if the shader parameter can not be retrieved.

The full network of the shader given by `shader` is available
to be queried. Parameters on shaders in the network other than the
output shader can be specified as `shaderName.parameterName`.

> Note : If either the shader or parameter does not exist then the
> query will not be performed and all outputs will be set to their
> default values.

out
---

The parent plug of the query outputs. The order of outputs corresponds
to the order of children of `queries`.
