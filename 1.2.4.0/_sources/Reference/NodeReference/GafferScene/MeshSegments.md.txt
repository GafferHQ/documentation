MeshSegments
============

Creates a uniform primitive variable of integer indices indicating which
connected segment each face belongs to.  May create segments based on
what is connected in the mesh's topology, or based on an indexed
primitive variable ( for example, you may segment based on which faces
share UVs in order to segment into UV islands ).

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

connectivity
------------

The name of the primitive variable which will determine the segmentation.
You may specify an empty string, or any vertex primitive variable to use
the vertex topology to determine segments, or use an indexed face-varying
primitive variable - this will segment based on which face-vertices are
connected ( for example, using indexed UVs will produce UV islands ).
Uniform and constant primitive variables are also supported for consistency,
but they just output which faces have the same uniform value, or put all
faces in one segment.

segment
-------

The name of the uniform primitive variable which will be created to hold
the segment index for each face.
