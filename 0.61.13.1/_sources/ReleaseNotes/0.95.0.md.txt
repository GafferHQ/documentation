0.95.0
======

#### UI

- Improved SceneReader UI with right click menu for toggling tags on and off in the tags and sets plugs.

#### Core

- Fixed bug with references containing non-default plug values ([#844](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/844)).

#### Scene

- Added preliminary support for sets ([#92](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/92)).
	- Added a Set node. This allows users to manage sets of named locations (with optional wildcards) as part of their graph flow.
	- Replaced "gaffer:forwardDeclarations" globals entry with a private set named "__lights".
	- Updated hierarchy modifying nodes to also modify sets to keep them in sync with the hierarchy.
	- Implemented loading of tags as sets in SceneReader.
	- An upcoming release will contain a SetFilter for actually making the sets useful.
- Added a FreezeTransform node ([#822](https://github.com/GafferHQ/gaffer/issues/822)).

#### RenderMan

- Fixes IPR bug where shaders could leak onto the wrong objects.

#### API

- Typedefed PathMatcherData into GafferScene namespace.
- Optimised PathMatcher (the underlying data structure for sets).
- Replaced GafferScene::Render base class with RendererAlgo.h header.
- Simplified Executable nodes and tidied up implementation, in preparation for actually integrating Despatchers properly.
