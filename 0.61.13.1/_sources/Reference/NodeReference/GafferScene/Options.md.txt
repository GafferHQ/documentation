Options
=======

The base type for nodes that apply options to the scene.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

options
-------

The options to be applied - arbitrary numbers of user defined options may be added
as children of this plug via the user interface, or using the CompoundDataPlug API via
python.

extraOptions
------------

An additional set of options to be added. Arbitrary numbers
of options may be specified within a single `IECore.CompoundObject`,
where each key/value pair in the object defines an option.
This is convenient when using an expression to define the options
and the option count might be dynamic. It can also be used to
create options whose type cannot be handled by the `options`
CompoundDataPlug.

If the same option is defined by both the `options` and the
`extraOptions` plugs, then the value from the `extraOptions`
is taken.
