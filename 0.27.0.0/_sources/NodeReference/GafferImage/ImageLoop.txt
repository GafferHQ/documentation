ImageLoop
=========

Applies a user defined processing loop to an image. The content
of the loop is defined by the node network placed between the
previous and next plugs. The input image is sent around this
loop for a set number of iterations and then emerges as the
output image.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image

next
----

The image to be used as the start of the next iteration of
the loop.

previous
--------

The result from the previous iteration of the loop, or
the input image if no iterations have been performed yet.
The content of the loop is defined by feeding this previous
result through the image processing nodes of choice and back
around into the next plug.

iterations
----------

The number of times the loop is applied to form the output
image.

indexVariable
-------------

The name of a context variable used to specify the index
of the current iteration. This can be referenced from
expressions within the loop network to modify the operations
performed during each iteration of the loop.
