ImageTransform
==============

Scales, rotates and translates an image within its display window.
Note that although the format is not changed, the data window is
expanded to include the portions of the image which have been
transformed outside of the display window, and these out-of-frame
pixels can still be used by downstream nodes.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The input image

transform
---------

The transformation to be applied to the image. The translate
and pivot values are specified in pixels, and the rotate
value is specified in degrees.

filter
------

The pixel filter used when transforming the image. Each
filter provides different tradeoffs between sharpness and
the danger of aliasing or ringing.
