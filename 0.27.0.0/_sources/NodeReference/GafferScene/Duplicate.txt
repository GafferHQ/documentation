Duplicate
=========

Duplicates a part of the scene. The duplicates
are parented alongside the original, and have
a transform applied to them.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

parent
------

For internal use only.

target
------

The part of the scene to be duplicated.

copies
------

The number of copies to be made.

name
----

The name given to the copies. If this
is left empty, the name from the target
will be used instead. The names will have
a numeric suffix applied to distinguish
between the different copies, unless only a
single copy is being made. Even in the case
of a single copy, a suffix will be applied
if necessary to keep the names unique.

transform
---------

The transform to be applied to the copies. The transform
is applied iteratively, so the second copy is transformed
twice, the third copy is transformed three times and so on.
