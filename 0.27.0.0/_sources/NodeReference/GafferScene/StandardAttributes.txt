StandardAttributes
==================

Modifies the standard attributes on objects - these should
be respected by all renderers.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

attributes
----------

The attributes to be applied - arbitrary numbers of user defined
attributes may be added as children of this plug via the user
interface, or using the CompoundDataPlug API via python.

attributes.visibility
---------------------

Whether or not the object can be seen - invisible objects are
not sent to the renderer at all. Typically more fine
grained (camera, reflection etc) visibility can be
specified using a renderer specific attributes node.
Note that making a parent location invisible will
always make all the children invisible too, regardless
of their visibility settings.

attributes.doubleSided
----------------------

Whether or not the object can be seen from both sides.
Single sided objects appear invisible when seen from
the back.

attributes.transformBlur
------------------------

Whether or not transformation animation on the
object is taken into account in the rendered image.
Use the transformBlurSegments plug to specify the number
of segments used to represent the motion.

attributes.transformBlurSegments
--------------------------------

The number of segments of transform animation to
pass to the renderer when transformBlur is on.

attributes.deformationBlur
--------------------------

Whether or not deformation animation on the
object is taken into account in the rendered image.
Use the deformationBlurSegments plug to specify the
number of segments used to represent the motion.

attributes.deformationBlurSegments
----------------------------------

The number of segments of transform animation to
pass to the renderer when transformBlur is on.

global
------

Causes the attributes to be applied to the scene globals
instead of the individual locations defined by the filter.
