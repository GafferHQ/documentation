MeshToPoints
============

Converts mesh primitives into points primitives.

Primitive variables with FaceVarying or Uniform
interpolation are discarded (because they have the
wrong size for the new primitive), but all other
primitive variables are preserved during conversion.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

type
----

The render type for the newly converted
points primitives.
