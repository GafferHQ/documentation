CustomOptions
=============

Applies arbitrary user-defined options to the root of the scene. Note
that for most common cases the StandardOptions, OpenGLOptions, RenderManOptions,
and ArnoldOptions nodes should be used in preference - they provide predefined
sets of options with customised user interfaces. The CustomOptions node is of most use when
needing to set a custom option not supported by the specialised nodes.
