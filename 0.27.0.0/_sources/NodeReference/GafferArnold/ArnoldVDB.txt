ArnoldVDB
=========

Creates an external procedural for rendering
VDB volumes in Arnold.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs
an empty scene.

name
----

The name of the object in the output scene.

sets
----

A list of sets to include the object in. The
names should be separated by spaces.

transform
---------

The transform applied to the object.

fileName
--------

The name of the VDB file to be loaded.

**Supported file extensions** : vdb

grids
-----

A space separated list of grids to be loaded and made available as
channels in the volume shader.

velocityGrids
-------------

A space separated list of grids used to be used to generate motion
blur. Should either contain a single vector grid or 3 float grids.

velocityScale
-------------

A scale factor applied to the velocity grids, to either increase
or decrease motion blur.

stepSize
--------

The ray marching step size. This should be small enough to capture
the smallest details in the volume. Values which are too large will
cause aliasing artifacts, and values which are too small will cause
rendering to be excessively slow. The default value of 0 causes the
size to be calculated automatically based on the resolution of the
VDB file. The step scale can then be used to make relative adjustments
on top of this automatic size.

stepScale
---------

A multiplier applied to the step size. This is most useful when the
step size is computed automatically. Typically stepScale would be
increased above 1 to give improved render times when it is known that
the VDB file doesn't have a lot of fine detail at the voxel level -
a value of 4 might be a good starting point for such a file.

dso
---

The file name of the volume plugin that will be used to load
the VDB file at render time. Currently this plugin is not supplied
with Arnold itself, but is provided with MtoA as
`procedurals/volume_vdb.so`, and with HtoA as
`arnold/procedurals/htoa_volume_openvdb.so`.

**Supported file extensions** : so, dylib
