AppleseedAttributes
===================

Applies appleseed attributes to objects
in the scene.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

attributes
----------

The attributes to be applied - arbitrary numbers of user defined
attributes may be added as children of this plug via the user
interface, or using the CompoundDataPlug API via python.

attributes.cameraVisibility
---------------------------

Whether or not the object is visible to camera
rays. To hide an object completely, use the
visibility settings on the StandardAttributes
node instead.

attributes.lightVisibility
--------------------------

Whether or not the object is visible to light
rays (whether or not it is visible to photons).

attributes.shadowVisibility
---------------------------

Whether or not the object is visible to shadow
rays (whether or not it casts shadows).

attributes.diffuseVisibility
----------------------------

Whether or not the object is visible to diffuse
rays - whether it casts bounce light or not.

attributes.specularVisibility
-----------------------------

Whether or not the object is visible in
tight mirror reflections and refractions.

attributes.glossyVisibility
---------------------------

Whether or not the object is visible in
soft specular reflections and refractions.

attributes.shadingSamples
-------------------------

Number of samples to use when computing shading for the object.

attributes.mediumPriority
-------------------------

Specify the object medium priority.
When multiple objects share the same volume, appleseed will consider
only the highest priority one for intersections and shading.
Sometimes called nested dielectrics in other renderers.

attributes.alphaMap
-------------------

Specifies a grayscale texture than can be used to efficiently discard
unwanted parts of the surface of the object while computing ray intersections.

global
------

Causes the attributes to be applied to the scene globals
instead of the individual locations defined by the filter.
