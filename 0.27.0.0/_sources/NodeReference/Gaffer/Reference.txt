Reference
=========

References a node network stored in another file. This can be used
to share resources among scripts, build powerful non-linear workflows,
and as the basis for custom asset management.

To generate a file to be referenced, build a network inside a Box
node and then export it for referencing.

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.
