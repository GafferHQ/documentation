ObjectReader
============

Loads objects from disk using the readers provided by
the Cortex project. In most cases it is preferable to
use a dedicated SceneReader or ImageReader instead of
this node.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

fileName
--------

The file to load.

**Supported file extensions** : bw, cin, cob, dexr, dpx, exr, idx, jpeg, jpg, mc, obj, pdc, png, rgb, rgba, sgi, swa, tdl, tga, tif, tiff

out
---

The loaded object. Note that the ObjectToScene node may
be used to convert this for use with the GafferScene
module.
