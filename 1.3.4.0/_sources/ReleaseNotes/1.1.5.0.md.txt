1.1.5.0
=======

Features
--------

- PrimitiveVariableQuery : Added new node to query multiple primitive variables from a scene location.
  - Each query specifies the name and type of the primitive variable
  - Each query has a corresponding output plug with `exists`, `interpolation`, `type` and `value` child plugs.

Improvements
------------

- ArnoldOptions : Added support for `texture_use_existing_tx`, `texture_auto_generate_tx` and `texture_auto_tx_path`.
- Arnold : Added support for attributes containing InternedStringData, as would be obtained by loading `token` primvars from a USD file.
- Random : Added the `outFloat` plug to the NodeEditor, and moved output plugs into their own `Outputs` section.

Fixes
-----

- Arnold :
  - Fixed deletion of `ai:transform_type` attribute during interactive renders. The object now reverts to the default transform type in this case.
  - Fixed broken Viewer after Arnold encountered an error (such as a missing texture).
  - Fixed `Tools/Arnold/Flush Cache` not working when no interactive renders are running.

API
---

- TypedObjectPlug : Added V2fVectorDataPlug and V3iVectorDataPlug.
- PlugAlgo : Added support for V2iVectorData, V3fVectorData and Color3fVectorData types in `canSetValueFromData()` and `setValueFromData()` functions.
- VectorDataPlugValueWidget : Added support for V2iVectorData and Color3fVectorData plug types.
