OSLObject
=========

Executes OSL shaders to perform object processing. Use the shaders from
the OSL/ObjectProcessing menu to read primitive variables from the input
object and then write primitive variables back to it.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

adjustBounds
------------

Adjusts bounding boxes to account for the changes made to the object.

> Caution : Adjusting boundings boxes has a performance penalty.
> If you do not need accurate bounds or you know that the bounds
> will only change slightly, you may prefer to turn this off.

interpolation
-------------

The interpolation type of the primitive variables created by this node.
For instance, Uniform interpolation means that the shader is run once per face on a mesh, allowing it to output primitive variables with a value per face.
All non-constant input primitive variables are resampled to match the selected interpolation so that they can be accessed from the shader.

useTransform
------------

Makes the object's transform available to OSL, so that you can use OSL functions that convert
from object to world space.

useAttributes
-------------

Makes the Gaffer attributes at the object's location available to OSL through the getattribute
function.  Once this is on, you can use OSL nodes such as InFloat or InString to retrieve the
attribute values.

primitiveVariables
------------------

Define primitive varibles to output by adding child plugs and connecting
corresponding OSL shaders.  Supported plug types are :

- FloatPlug
- IntPlug
- ColorPlug
- V3fPlug ( outputting vector, normal or point )
- M44fPlug
- StringPlug

If you want to add multiple outputs at once, you can also add a closure plug,
which can accept a connection from an OSLCode with a combined output closure.
