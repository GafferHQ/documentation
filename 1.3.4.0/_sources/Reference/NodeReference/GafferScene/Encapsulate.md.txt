Encapsulate
===========

Encapsulates a portion of the scene by collapsing the hierarchy
and replacing it with a procedural which will be evaluated at
render time.

This has two primary uses :

- To optimise scene generation. Downstream nodes do not see
  the encapsulated locations, so do not spend time processing
  them.
- To enable high-level instancing of hierarchies. If multiple
  copies of the encapsulated procedural are made by the
  downstream network, then the procedural itself can be instanced
  at render time. This works no matter how the copies are
  made, but typically the Instancer or Duplicate nodes would
  be the most common method of copying the procedural.

> Note : Encapsulation currently has some limitations

> - Motion blur attributes are not inherited - only
>   attributes within the encapsulated hierarchy are
>   considered.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.
