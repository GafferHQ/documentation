=============

Forms a series of image layers by repeatedly evaluating the input with different contexts.
Useful for networks that need to dynamically build an unknown number of image layers.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The output image generated by this node.

enabled
-------

Turns the node on and off.

in
--

The image which will be evaluated for each layer.

rootLayers
----------

A list of the new layers to create.

layerVariable
-------------

This context variable will be set with the current layer name when evaluating the in plug.
This allows you to vary the upstream processing for each new layer.
