Wireframe
=========

Creates a wireframe representation of a mesh. The wireframe
is created as a CurvesPrimitive.

user
----

Container for user-defined plugs. Nodes
should never make their own plugs here,
so users are free to do as they wish.

out
---

The processed output scene.

enabled
-------

The on/off state of the node. When it is off, the node outputs the input scene unchanged.

in
--

The input scene

filter
------

The filter used to control which parts of the scene are
processed. A Filter node should be connected here.

position
--------

The primitive variable containing the positions to use
for the wireframe. This must have either Vertex or FaceVarying
interpolation and contain either V3fVectorData or V2fVectorData.

> Tip : Use "uv" to create a wireframe representation of the
> UVs for a mesh.

width
-----

The width of the curves used to represent the wireframe.
